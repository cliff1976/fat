      <description>It was drizzling today, but I really wanted to get out of the house. I went up and down some of my favorite streets in the Altstadt, looking for new or changed places to eat and shop.

      <description>Went for a walk outside in bright sunny weather instead of a gym visit this time. We walked all the way from our house to Il Mercato and back, checking out the construction sites at Albertstraße and in the Dörnbergviertel.

      <description>Messed around and got there later than I intended — 9:30 instead of the crack of 9. It was already kinda smelly in there. I guess that&amp;rsquo;s my penance. Mix of old and young people, but very few in between in my demographic. The Crossfit OONCE OONCE OONCE started at 10, which is another reason to get in and get out before they crank it up.
Machine(s): elliptical Settings: incline 1, resistance 8 Time: 42 minutes Distance: 7.</description>
