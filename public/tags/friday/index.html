        It was another Kurzarbeit day. I had to skip my walks a couple days this week, so I stretched this out one longer on purpose. I made it up to the Fernsehturm in Ziegetsdorf, walked parallel to the A3 towards the Uniklinikum and back. It was threatening to rain most of the way with some nice patches of sun to break things up.

        Lots of pics and a longer route this time — thanks Kurzarbeit — to make up for yesterday&rsquo;s slacking.
This was the first time I explored the Unterer Wöhrd &ldquo;off-road.&rdquo; Found some shelters near the Jugendherberge that looked a little spooky. I don&rsquo;t know whether those are someone&rsquo;s emergency shelter or just a relaxing hideaway.

        This was the last chance to leave town before the Ausgangsbeschränkung went into effect at midnight tonight, so we took it. We also saw
 where our pal gets all those beautiful mystical forest shots of his dogs, and some ancient Celtic mystery forest stuff [cue the spooky music], and the foundations of an old Roman bathhouse as the ruins from a Villa Rustica  Route:

        This one proved that I can be at the gym at 7:02, get a decent amount of time in on the machine of my choice (they were all empty), and still walk back home with time to change into work clothes for a bike ride into work by 9:00. Or close enough to it.
