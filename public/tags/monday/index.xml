      <description>Holiday weekend! (Fronleichnam, I think). I took my first walk through the Evangelischer Zentralfriedhof, which had a nice mix of sun and shade. I was kind of expecting more activity in there due to the holiday, but there was no one stirring.
Snaps:
The pit between Alberstraße and Ernst-Reuter-Platz is now fully empty; still don&amp;rsquo;t know what&amp;rsquo;s going in there.
Absolutely nothing happening at Hauptbahnhof, which felt weird, even for a public holiday.</description>

Think of all the great grilled dinners we could have with these!
&amp;ldquo;Please wait to be seated&amp;rdquo; arrives in Germany with Corona.
Coming Home has taken over the space from &amp;ldquo;zum Sterischen Eck.&amp;rdquo; Hope it doesn&amp;rsquo;t suck.
Sweet upholstery on this Ente!

      <description>Threatening to rain all day today, and it actually did — a few drops at least on the way to REWE to get some groceries before work.
Flowers look nice at Luitpoldstraße and Sternbergstraße.
Also La Bona I mean &amp;ldquo;Orient Imbiss&amp;rdquo; has pita bread for sale on shelves on the street.

      <description>A cloudy, overcast morning. I was hoping for some nice sunrise edge-of-cloud views, but I think I was too late off the mark to get them. Instead I discovered a new (to me) tiny park almost directly south of our house. Also, I forgot to start my route tracker, so I missed the first 500 meters or so of the route. Dang it.

      <description>Took an evening walk with Sarah instead of my usual morning solo walk. Saw a few nice sunset scenes and discovered a hops garden in the Innere Osten neighborhood.

      <description>Another beautiful day. A Schnitzeljagd of sorts, even.
Weltenburger am Dom is closed, apparently not even doing take-out, but the Kreuzschänke is accepting carry-out orders. I like that they encourage their patrons to bring their own food storage containers to reduce waste.
Also, the Spanier im Bruckmandl is no more. Some kind of Currywurst joint is there now?

Apparently I lost a GPS connection for a while there. I did not march through people&amp;rsquo;s homes.</description>

      <description>Another beautiful day.
Got started later than normal. Yesterday was a 16km stroll, so today&amp;rsquo;s walk of only 5.2km and starting later felt justified.

      <description>Another beautiful day. Went south and east along Alfons-Auer-Straße. Nothing spectacular to see there, really, but the Edeka on Hornstraße is pretty easy to reach from there.

      <description>Felt like it was harder to stay in the target heart range &amp;ndash; maybe because of the four-day gap since the previous workout. I may need to start going more than 3 days a week, which also means maybe going on at least one weekend day, eating into shopping time on Saturdays, or being crowded on Sundays. Yuck.

      <description>Gotta make sure my chest is good and wet before I get started. The watch was having trouble reading my pulse (although the Precor elliptical thing appeared to have no problem&amp;hellip;).
