      <description>Another kooky GPX track. Harumph. No way I did 9+ km yesterday morning before work.
Some thoughts on schaffen: see my post on bergberg.net.
And it looks like the city has some schaffen planned for our street.

      <description>Oops, forgot to bring my watch on my walk, so I have no heart rate stats for this one. Also, nothing leapt out at me as photo-worthy. But at least I discovered the Gemüsebagels at Der Beck are pretty good.

      <description>Another beautiful day. Got started earlier than normal thanks to an 8:00 meeting. 3rd in a row. Criminy.
Figured out that a brisk walk to/from work, if I ever go back there, is nearly exactly a 30-minute affair (using the bike paths and avoiding traffic lights).

      <description>Another beautiful day. Finally made it up to the top of the Dreifaltigkeitsberg. Walked down the east face of the hill towards the Regen banks and made my way from there back home via the Nibelungenbrücke.

      <description>I knew Friday wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to be an option due to a work meeting at 07:30. This messes up my whole MWF vibe, but it won&amp;rsquo;t be the last time.
