I had to skip my walks a couple days this week, so I stretched this out one longer on purpose. I made it up to the Fernsehturm in Ziegetsdorf, walked parallel to the A3 towards the Uniklinikum and back. It was threatening to rain most of the way with some nice patches of sun to break things up.

I took my first walk through the Evangelischer Zentralfriedhof, which had a nice mix of sun and shade. I was kind of expecting more activity in there due to the holiday, but there was no one stirring.
Snaps:

The pit between Alberstraße and Ernst-Reuter-Platz is now fully empty; still don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going in there.

Absolutely nothing happening at Hauptbahnhof, which felt weird, even for a public holiday.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/workout/">workout</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/monday/">Monday</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/workouts/2020-05-27/">

I crossed onto one of the islands in Danube. Took another look at one of those sheltery things I&rsquo;d seen there previously. Still creepy. The channels were peaceful. There was a weird Yoda/Nosferatu hybrid graffito thing.

Think of all the great grilled dinners we could have with these!

&ldquo;Please wait to be seated&rdquo; arrives in Germany with Corona.

Coming Home has taken over the space from &ldquo;zum Sterischen Eck.&rdquo; Hope it doesn&rsquo;t suck.

Sweet upholstery on this Ente!

Some thoughts on schaffen: see my post on bergberg.net.
And it looks like the city has some schaffen planned for our street.

But walked along the Wöhrd and took the stairs right down the water line in a few places. It&rsquo;s been somewhat rainy, but the river wasn&rsquo;t running particularly high or fast. I got a special treat: watching a barge with a lift switch out a riverway sign.

Flowers look nice at Luitpoldstraße and Sternbergstraße.
Also La Bona I mean &ldquo;Orient Imbiss&rdquo; has pita bread for sale on shelves on the street.
