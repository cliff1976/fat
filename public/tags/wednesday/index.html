        Another beautiful day.
I crossed onto one of the islands in Danube. Took another look at one of those sheltery things I&rsquo;d seen there previously. Still creepy. The channels were peaceful. There was a weird Yoda/Nosferatu hybrid graffito thing.

        Sure don&rsquo;t remember teleporting home from Neupfarrplatz! Maybe it has something do with the giant golden sperm attacking the city.

        A pretty dreary morning (most of them have been lately after those glorious weeks in March and April). But walked along the Wöhrd and took the stairs right down the water line in a few places. It&rsquo;s been somewhat rainy, but the river wasn&rsquo;t running particularly high or fast. I got a special treat: watching a barge with a lift switch out a riverway sign.

        A moderately rainy morning after several weeks of almost no rain. No inspiring photographs today; my walk was through neighborhoods and apartment complexes.
I did notice the Singh Indischer Markt seems to have been replaced with a Middle Eastern market of some kind.
And somehow I must have lost GPS connectivity along the way there towards the end, because I definitely did not sneak through anyone&rsquo;s house. Promise.

        Another beautiful day.
Did a loop behind the Max-Straße McD&rsquo;s up and down some steps for fun. It was not very fun.

It would appear that my app did not save my route. It was from our house through the southern end of the Altstadt with some loops in the western part, and back home via the south bank of the Danube.

        Another beautiful day. Got started earlier than normal thanks to an 8:00 meeting. 2nd in a row. Work is a pain like that.
Remember: you can get gelbe Säcke at the HEM Tankstelle on Friedenstraße 24 hours a day!

        Second weigh-in of the year. Gained a pound(ish). I think the increassed activity these past two weeks has made me hungrier, and I&rsquo;m eating more. Guess that&rsquo;s OK as long as it&rsquo;s the low-cal stuff.

        First weigh-in of the year. Surprisingly: I&rsquo;m down about 9.5 kg from June 2019 and 8 kg from October 2019 at the doctor&rsquo;s office. Either:
 one (or both?) of the scales are miscalibrated, or I have lost weight by going on vacation in December (???), or something evil is happening and I&rsquo;m losing weight for bad reasons.
