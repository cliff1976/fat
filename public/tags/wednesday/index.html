I crossed onto one of the islands in Danube. Took another look at one of those sheltery things I&rsquo;d seen there previously. Still creepy. The channels were peaceful. There was a weird Yoda/Nosferatu hybrid graffito thing.

But walked along the Wöhrd and took the stairs right down the water line in a few places. It&rsquo;s been somewhat rainy, but the river wasn&rsquo;t running particularly high or fast. I got a special treat: watching a barge with a lift switch out a riverway sign.

I did notice the Singh Indischer Markt seems to have been replaced with a Middle Eastern market of some kind.
And somehow I must have lost GPS connectivity along the way there towards the end, because I definitely did not sneak through anyone&rsquo;s house. Promise.

Did a loop behind the Max-Straße McD&rsquo;s up and down some steps for fun. It was not very fun.

It would appear that my app did not save my route. It was from our house through the southern end of the Altstadt with some loops in the western part, and back home via the south bank of the Danube.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/workout/">workout</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/wednesday/">Wednesday</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/workouts/2020-04-01/">
