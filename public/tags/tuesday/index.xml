      <description>I walked into work, grabbed some masks from my desk the company had set out for me, and came back via the supermarket. It was longer and slower, but I bought groceries, ran an errand, and even saw another person in the office, in person &amp;ndash; did not expect that. I might have surprised her, too.
Lone Snap:
That mosque near work is coming along nicely. Looking forward to their lunch counter opening&amp;hellip;if I ever return to working in the office.</description>

      <description>GPS went nutty again today. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if
 it&amp;rsquo;s something atmospheric, or the satellites were out of alignment, or the case on my phone, or whether or not the phone&amp;rsquo;s in a pocket or loose in my hand, or an intermittent hardware problem is wreaking havoc  But I for sure did not follow the exact path shown in the route.
I did find the use of rubber gloves hanging from the bridge the near florist&amp;rsquo;s shop under the bridge quite attractive.</description>

      <description>A somewhat less beautiful day. I went for a walk after work, instead of before it. It was overcast and cool, but still okay for getting a strenuous walk in.

      <description>Another beautiful day.
Had to wait for a train in the Hafengebiet. Crossed a waterway along a train bridge — next time I think I&amp;rsquo;ll go all the way to Schwabelweis for a longer walk. Weird junky art stuff near the industrial recycling place right at the path leading from the bridge back down onto the south bank of the Danube.

      <description>Another beautiful day. Went north and east near Sedanstraße and back through the Candis Park. Kind of an interesting mix of pretty, ugly, and ultra-modern dwellings all in this area.
