It was longer and slower, but I bought groceries, ran an errand, and even saw another person in the office, in person &ndash; did not expect that. I might have surprised her, too.
Lone Snap:

That mosque near work is coming along nicely. Looking forward to their lunch counter opening&hellip;if I ever return to working in the office.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/workout/">workout</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/tuesday/">Tuesday</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/workouts/2020-05-12/">

 it&rsquo;s something atmospheric, or the satellites were out of alignment, or the case on my phone, or whether or not the phone&rsquo;s in a pocket or loose in my hand, or an intermittent hardware problem is wreaking havoc  But I for sure did not follow the exact path shown in the route.
I did find the use of rubber gloves hanging from the bridge the near florist&rsquo;s shop under the bridge quite attractive.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/workout/">workout</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/tuesday/">Tuesday</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/workouts/2020-04-14/">

Had to wait for a train in the Hafengebiet. Crossed a waterway along a train bridge — next time I think I&rsquo;ll go all the way to Schwabelweis for a longer walk. Weird junky art stuff near the industrial recycling place right at the path leading from the bridge back down onto the south bank of the Danube.

Went north and east near Sedanstraße and back through the Candis Park. Kind of an interesting mix of pretty, ugly, and ultra-modern dwellings all in this area.
