I&rsquo;d taken a couple weekends off, which stretched out to over a month, because I was worried about the moisture on the ground and the wintry temperatures resulting in icy conditions. I tried to walk more in the meantime. That kinda worked, but not as much as I&rsquo;d hoped.
I thought it was a little weird to leave Regensburg and cross into Baiern. I mean the standard local historical thing is that Regensburg was a free imperial city for a long time and by crossing the Danube into Stadtamhof, one was leaving Regensburg and entering Bavaria (Bayern).<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/walks/20210112/">

Some local pals suggested this route through the woods starting outside of Wenzenbach, heading north. It was very pretty, and would have been quite short, but for the icy trails. Much of it runs parallel to a few creeks, so there was a lot of moisture to contend with &ndash; and much of it had turned to ice.
Notes  need new hiking boots (soles are pretty much gone on mine) consider  buying &ldquo;hiking poles&rdquo; (&quot;Wanderstöcke&quot;) bringing crampons along next time getting a thermos; really could have used a warm beverage, like  hot chocolate tea/coffee Glühwein (make Sarah drive)      Snaps<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/walks/2020-12-30/">

This was a parking garage less than a year ago.

I don&rsquo;t know how long it&rsquo;s been there, but there&rsquo;s a Bucherzelle at the Andreasstadel in Stadtamhof now. Looks like they&rsquo;ve had trouble with people using it improperly. I hope that behavior doesn&rsquo;t doom it.
