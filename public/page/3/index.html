So I did a long walk instead.
Snaps Got a new sweatshirt for my recent birthday from my parents. That thing is warm. Was great today for this long, dreary walk.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/walks/2020-12-11/">

The canal under the Grieser Steg was a pretty shade of green.

When I crossed into Stadtamhof, I saw the Spital brewery is advertising a Halbe Radler with a motorcycling monkey logo. I hope there&rsquo;s an inside joke in there I&rsquo;m just not getting.

I did a nice long one with her on a day when we also did the grocery shopping on foot. So there were almost thirteen that day. I only wore the heart rate monitor for the dog walk part of the day (in red solid lines).

            <p class="note title">Around Donau Park</p><p class="note date">Sunday, December 6, 2020</p><p class="note content">After last week&rsquo;s flat Danube odyssey, I thought I could probably handle at least the uphill bits on the way to Pentling and bask in the river bank&rsquo;s flat glory on my way back — especially since I didn&rsquo;t feel like a three-hour tour (a three-hour tour) today, and chopped my route down to a mere 20 km.
I was right in theory; but in practice, GraphHopper picked a route for me right up a tractor track between a couple of fields, which was steeper than I expected.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/bikerides/20201130-flatter-to-pfatter/">

I thought I would give the ol' quadriceps a break and stick to some very level terrain. You can&rsquo;t go wrong with following the Danube for a nice, level ride. I still managed to take a wrong turn or two, but I never had to backtrack. In a couple places along my route, it&rsquo;s not obvious whether a biker should go left or right to stay on a path.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/walks/november-impressions/">

One thing or another hat foiled each of my attempts. I took another shot at it today. Foiled again.
 I got off to a weak start just north of Stadtamhof at the Dreifaltigkeitsberg. A one-lane road shared with cars in both directions is daunting enough on its own.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/bikerides/20201108-victory-loop-foiled/">

I carefully mapped my route using GraphHopper and thought I was good-to-go for a route mostly following three rivers
 Danube Naab Schwarze Laber  &hellip; with a little hilliness in the middle to keep it interesting. The stretch up the hill from Etterzhausen to Nittendorf was a slog, but I knew that was coming, and I thought perhaps I&rsquo;d progressed in my endurance such that it wouldn&rsquo;t kill me.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/bikerides/20201101-daredevil-chicken/">

 Note to self: remember that the camera has no internal battery and you have to set the date and time with every battery change!
I took a suggestion from local pal Markus and went out southwest towards Mangolding, Mintraching and Geisling. Those were new towns for me, but the route back along the B8 through Barbing was old hat. Pretty flat the whole way, so it should have been a good opportunity to keep my heart rate low and steady.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li></ul><div class="pagination">
