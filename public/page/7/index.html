Didn&rsquo;t stick. Thought I&rsquo;d conquer that hill through the woods outside Leoprechting. Nope! Had to push my bike for a lot of it. At least partly that&rsquo;s because the dirt track had turned into mud and a tractor chewed it up real good 5 minutes before me.
I rode past the Continental Arena and then through a field (didn&rsquo;t like that so much; felt like trespassing), towards Leoprechting, onto Niedergebraching 1, and the clouds were ominous.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/workouts/2020-04-29/">

I did notice the Singh Indischer Markt seems to have been replaced with a Middle Eastern market of some kind.
And somehow I must have lost GPS connectivity along the way there towards the end, because I definitely did not sneak through anyone&rsquo;s house. Promise.

I thought by doing another few dozen kilometers today after just doing it on Sunday I would feel less sore, and build up some butt callouses.
Nope! But it was a nice ride anyways. The part of the Regensburg-Falkenstein bike route on an old train track was great and deserves more attention. The bit through the Kreuther Forst was a bit much going up, but coming down above the Donaustauf Klinik was nice.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/workouts/2020-04-27/">
            <p class="note title">Workout 2020 04 27</p><p class="note date">Monday, April 27, 2020</p><p class="note content">A cloudy, overcast morning. I was hoping for some nice sunrise edge-of-cloud views, but I think I was too late off the mark to get them. Instead I discovered a new (to me) tiny park almost directly south of our house. Also, I forgot to start my route tracker, so I missed the first 500 meters or so of the route. Dang it.

I&rsquo;ve seen the Donau Radweg route signs for 16 years, but I never followed them outside of town.
I rode towards work, took the Osttangente / Odessaring bridge to the baseball stadium, started tracing the Danube right away. But it didn&rsquo;t last too long, jutting south of Tegernheim and catching back up to the river bank about two thirds of the way to Donaustauf.
About half way through, my butt started hurting, so I took an inland shortcut instead of following the last Danube curve towards the bridge outside Pfatter, and then opted for the straighter inland route back into Regensburg, past IKEA and work again.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/bikerides/20200422-kurzarbeit-rivery-loop/">

My brain still woke me up at workday time, so why not make a bike ride of it? It was kind of cold for just shorts and a teesh, but I figured that&rsquo;s motivation for me to keep moving. Right in the first 10 minutes I spotted two old pals, one of whom has a new doggy, &ldquo;Spock&rdquo;. That was along the Danube.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/workouts/2020-04-21/">

By the end of my ride, the clouds started looming and threatening rain, but I got home before that started. And it blew over anyways.
I had worried about two things:
  Headed south out of Regensburg is a more direct route, but getting up those hills and down in to Bad Abbach would be a real pain.
  The ferry at Matting would be closed due to Corona stuff.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/workouts/2020-04-16/">

This was the first time I explored the Unterer Wöhrd &ldquo;off-road.&rdquo; Found some shelters near the Jugendherberge that looked a little spooky. I don&rsquo;t know whether those are someone&rsquo;s emergency shelter or just a relaxing hideaway.
