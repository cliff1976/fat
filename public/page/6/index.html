It was longer and slower, but I bought groceries, ran an errand, and even saw another person in the office, in person &ndash; did not expect that. I might have surprised her, too.

That mosque near work is coming along nicely.

I think I need to accept that the difficulty level listed as medium by the Landkreis does not (yet) match up to my expectations for medium. OTOH, I neglected to notice a town called &ldquo;Großberg&rdquo; on the itinerary. Duh!
I actually rode a little further than the route suggests; I forgot to start recording my GPX track until I was already up the hill at Bajuwarenstraße.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/workouts/2020-05-14/">

Some thoughts on schaffen: see my post on bergberg.net.
And it looks like the city has some schaffen planned for our street.

But walked along the Wöhrd and took the stairs right down the water line in a few places. It&rsquo;s been somewhat rainy, but the river wasn&rsquo;t running particularly high or fast. I got a special treat: watching a barge with a lift switch out a riverway sign.

 it&rsquo;s something atmospheric, or the satellites were out of alignment, or the case on my phone, or whether or not the phone&rsquo;s in a pocket or loose in my hand, or an intermittent hardware problem is wreaking havoc  But I for sure did not follow the exact path shown in the route.

Flowers look nice at Luitpoldstraße and Sternbergstraße.
Also La Bona I mean &ldquo;Orient Imbiss&rdquo; has pita bread for sale on shelves on the street.

The first leg was on the west bank of the Regen up to Regenstauf. I&rsquo;d done that before. Very nice and level.
The new bits started at Ramspau. It got lots more challenging from that point on. I thought it would be done with at Kürn, but nope. The path was sometimes paved, sometimes supposed to be paved, but under construction, and sometimes forest trail.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/workouts/2020-05-07/">

The rivery parts along the Naab all the way up to Pielenhofen and the monastery on the river were nice and gentle. I took a little water and banana break there. But that&rsquo;s where it started to get demanding. Just outside of Wall I thought to myself
