Walking the next day is a real pain. But those 50ish km rides have all been with a mixture of terrain. So I thought I would try a longer — but flatter — ride along the Danube today. I rode from our house to Wörth an der Donau and back.
Guess what? The knees are a little better off for it, but DA BUTT is not.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/bikerides/20200726-dog-scared-me-off/">

I&rsquo;ve been lazy about posting them, but less lazy about actually doing them. So that&rsquo;s good.
In my last post, I picked GraphHopper.com as a mapping service, but I&rsquo;m wary of it now. This time it routed me through a farm at the top of a long, slow hill at Aignhof&hellip; and a Rottweiler-looking dog was quite angry at my presence.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/bikerides/20200628-laaber-and-back/">

I had an important week at work last week, so to be there for all of it, I opted to make my last Kurzabeit day of the month the last Monday of the month instead of Friday.
I planned out my route using GraphHopper.com &ndash; first time using that service, but I am sure I&rsquo;ll be back.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/workouts/2020-06-05/">

I had to skip my walks a couple days this week, so I stretched this out one longer on purpose. I made it up to the Fernsehturm in Ziegetsdorf, walked parallel to the A3 towards the Uniklinikum and back. It was threatening to rain most of the way with some nice patches of sun to break things up.

I took my first walk through the Evangelischer Zentralfriedhof, which had a nice mix of sun and shade. I was kind of expecting more activity in there due to the holiday, but there was no one stirring.
Snaps:

The pit between Alberstraße and Ernst-Reuter-Platz is now fully empty; still don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going in there.

Absolutely nothing happening at Hauptbahnhof, which felt weird, even for a public holiday.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/workout/">workout</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/monday/">Monday</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/bikerides/20200529-flattening-the-curve/">

I decided not to torture myself with a mountainous bike ride, but instead stick to a flat loop out south and east of town. This was along the R7 route recommended by the Landkreis Regensburg.

I crossed onto one of the islands in Danube. Took another look at one of those sheltery things I&rsquo;d seen there previously. Still creepy. The channels were peaceful. There was a weird Yoda/Nosferatu hybrid graffito thing.

It was not another beautiful day. It started off with ominous clouds, that were true omens, because the hail they pelted me with stung. But at least not for long.
