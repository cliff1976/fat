            <p class="note title">Down one side and back up the other</p><p class="note date">Sunday, October 25, 2020</p><p class="note content">I biked up the hill to Pentling (hey! The bridge over the A3 is open again!) and down the hill from there towards Matting where I met up with my pal Sam for lunch. Then we took the ferry across (1€ per person) to the west (north?) bank of the Danube towards Bad Abbach, where we crossed it again using the bridge there. That&rsquo;s where we parted ways; I headed back downstream (north/east) towards Regensburg.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/bikerides/20201018-october-ride/">
            <p class="note title">October Ride</p><p class="note date">Sunday, October 18, 2020</p><p class="note content">First time back in the saddle after about a month, and it is no longer Panama Jack helmet weather. Also, when I got started this morning, it was foggy as heck, so I through on an eye-catching vest just for good measure. After about 30 minutes, it wasn&rsquo;t really necessary anymore &ndash; the sun burned off the low-hanging clouds.
I stuck to a very familiar route, since I haven&rsquo;t been on the bike in about a month.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/walks/bonndorf-exploration-part-2/">

I had mapped out a nice route of nearly exactly 50 km, heading south on our street to Oberhinkofen, and then turning west towards Teugn to come up into Bad Abbach from the south, but &hellip; something was amiss in the state of Denmark, if you know what I mean, and given that it was a Sunday morning before 9:00, and nothing was going to be open, I opted to head into Bad Abbach from the east and headed home from there.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/bikerides/20200913-secret-flugplatz/">

I woke up just before 6, got my coffee on, and was out on the road at 7:45. I&rsquo;ve started a couple bikerides this year intending to make it all the way to Kallmünz. Today was another of those that fell short. Not that the ride wasn&rsquo;t fulfilling. I didn&rsquo;t know there was a Flugplatz in Oberhub, so I detoured even more up a hill to check it out.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/bikerides/20200906-proesslbraeu-matting-and-back/">

A couple weekends ago our pal Special K came up to visit and brought her bike. That Saturday it rained like God had decided on a Do-Over, but there was a pottery market happening at Kloster Adlersberg. I thought that would be a nice bike destination under decent weather conditions, and I was right.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/bikerides/20200816-loch-ellmau/">

I thought I would treat myself to some nice flat stretches along a river for the last leg. I am not so sure that is the right approach; &ldquo;mostly flat&rdquo; is &ldquo;partly hilly&rdquo; and even where truly flat, I was tired of being in the saddle, and mad at friction for forcing me to keep pedaling.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li></ul><div class="pagination">
