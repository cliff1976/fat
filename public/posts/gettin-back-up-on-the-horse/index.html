    <h1 class="article title">Gettin' Back Up on the Horse</h1><p class="article date">Sunday, February 2, 2020</p></section><article class="article markdown-body"><p>It&rsquo;s February 2020.  Anyone with flimsy resolutions in January has probably already broken them.  This is a good time for my ass to get back into a routine.</p>
<p>My excuse through most of last year was that work was getting in the way; too many meetings before 9:00 a.m., and experience has shown that I have to do my gym shit in the morning, or not at all.  And since the gym doesn&rsquo;t open until 7:00, that meant not at all.</p>
<p>Which was a cop-out.</p>
<p>Screw that.  Work is not getting better, but I am getting worse.  So no more meetings before 9:00 a.m. anymore.  And therefore no excuse not to put in my time 3 days per week.</p>
