        It was another Kurzarbeit day. I had to skip my walks a couple days this week, so I stretched this out one longer on purpose. I made it up to the Fernsehturm in Ziegetsdorf, walked parallel to the A3 towards the Uniklinikum and back. It was threatening to rain most of the way with some nice patches of sun to break things up.

        Holiday weekend! (Fronleichnam, I think). I took my first walk through the Evangelischer Zentralfriedhof, which had a nice mix of sun and shade. I was kind of expecting more activity in there due to the holiday, but there was no one stirring.
Snaps:
The pit between Alberstraße and Ernst-Reuter-Platz is now fully empty; still don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going in there.
Absolutely nothing happening at Hauptbahnhof, which felt weird, even for a public holiday.

        Another beautiful day.
I crossed onto one of the islands in Danube. Took another look at one of those sheltery things I&rsquo;d seen there previously. Still creepy. The channels were peaceful. There was a weird Yoda/Nosferatu hybrid graffito thing.

        I walked into work, grabbed some masks from my desk the company had set out for me, and came back via the supermarket. It was longer and slower, but I bought groceries, ran an errand, and even saw another person in the office, in person &ndash; did not expect that. I might have surprised her, too.
Lone Snap:
That mosque near work is coming along nicely. Looking forward to their lunch counter opening&hellip;if I ever return to working in the office.

        A pretty dreary morning (most of them have been lately after those glorious weeks in March and April). But walked along the Wöhrd and took the stairs right down the water line in a few places. It&rsquo;s been somewhat rainy, but the river wasn&rsquo;t running particularly high or fast. I got a special treat: watching a barge with a lift switch out a riverway sign.

        GPS went nutty again today. I don&rsquo;t know if
 it&rsquo;s something atmospheric, or the satellites were out of alignment, or the case on my phone, or whether or not the phone&rsquo;s in a pocket or loose in my hand, or an intermittent hardware problem is wreaking havoc  But I for sure did not follow the exact path shown in the route.
I did find the use of rubber gloves hanging from the bridge the near florist&rsquo;s shop under the bridge quite attractive.

        Threatening to rain all day today, and it actually did — a few drops at least on the way to REWE to get some groceries before work.
Flowers look nice at Luitpoldstraße and Sternbergstraße.
Also La Bona I mean &ldquo;Orient Imbiss&rdquo; has pita bread for sale on shelves on the street.

        A moderately rainy morning after several weeks of almost no rain. No inspiring photographs today; my walk was through neighborhoods and apartment complexes.
I did notice the Singh Indischer Markt seems to have been replaced with a Middle Eastern market of some kind.
And somehow I must have lost GPS connectivity along the way there towards the end, because I definitely did not sneak through anyone&rsquo;s house. Promise.

        A cloudy, overcast morning. I was hoping for some nice sunrise edge-of-cloud views, but I think I was too late off the mark to get them. Instead I discovered a new (to me) tiny park almost directly south of our house. Also, I forgot to start my route tracker, so I missed the first 500 meters or so of the route. Dang it.

This was the first time I explored the Unterer Wöhrd &ldquo;off-road.&rdquo; Found some shelters near the Jugendherberge that looked a little spooky. I don&rsquo;t know whether those are someone&rsquo;s emergency shelter or just a relaxing hideaway.

Weltenburger am Dom is closed, apparently not even doing take-out, but the Kreuzschänke is accepting carry-out orders. I like that they encourage their patrons to bring their own food storage containers to reduce waste.
Also, the Spanier im Bruckmandl is no more. Some kind of Currywurst joint is there now?

        Another beautiful day. Finally made it up to the top of the Dreifaltigkeitsberg. Walked down the east face of the hill towards the Regen banks and made my way from there back home via the Nibelungenbrücke.

        Felt like it was harder to stay in the target heart range &ndash; maybe because of the four-day gap since the previous workout. I may need to start going more than 3 days a week, which also means maybe going on at least one weekend day, eating into shopping time on Saturdays, or being crowded on Sundays. Yuck.

        A little late getting started today, but my first meeting (working from home) was not until 09:30, so NBD. After this workout, I adjusted my watches settings to reflect my weight of 114 kg (it was set at 123 kg from my last doctor visit).

        Messed around and got there later than I intended — 9:30 instead of the crack of 9. It was already kinda smelly in there. I guess that&rsquo;s my penance. Mix of old and young people, but very few in between in my demographic. The Crossfit OONCE OONCE OONCE started at 10, which is another reason to get in and get out before they crank it up.

        Second weigh-in of the year. Gained a pound(ish). I think the increassed activity these past two weeks has made me hungrier, and I&rsquo;m eating more. Guess that&rsquo;s OK as long as it&rsquo;s the low-cal stuff.

        This one proved that I can be at the gym at 7:02, get a decent amount of time in on the machine of my choice (they were all empty), and still walk back home with time to change into work clothes for a bike ride into work by 9:00. Or close enough to it.

        First weigh-in of the year. Surprisingly: I&rsquo;m down about 9.5 kg from June 2019 and 8 kg from October 2019 at the doctor&rsquo;s office. Either:
 one (or both?) of the scales are miscalibrated, or I have lost weight by going on vacation in December (???), or something evil is happening and I&rsquo;m losing weight for bad reasons.
