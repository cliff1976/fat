I went up and down some of my favorite streets in the Altstadt, looking for new or changed places to eat and shop.

I did notice the Singh Indischer Markt seems to have been replaced with a Middle Eastern market of some kind.
And somehow I must have lost GPS connectivity along the way there towards the end, because I definitely did not sneak through anyone&rsquo;s house. Promise.

I was hoping for some nice sunrise edge-of-cloud views, but I think I was too late off the mark to get them. Instead I discovered a new (to me) tiny park almost directly south of our house. Also, I forgot to start my route tracker, so I missed the first 500 meters or so of the route. Dang it.

This was the first time I explored the Unterer Wöhrd &ldquo;off-road.&rdquo; Found some shelters near the Jugendherberge that looked a little spooky. I don&rsquo;t know whether those are someone&rsquo;s emergency shelter or just a relaxing hideaway.

Weltenburger am Dom is closed, apparently not even doing take-out, but the Kreuzschänke is accepting carry-out orders. I like that they encourage their patrons to bring their own food storage containers to reduce waste.
Also, the Spanier im Bruckmandl is no more. Some kind of Currywurst joint is there now?
