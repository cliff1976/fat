        Lest ye fret: I&rsquo;m still here, and still walking and biking (though not as consistently as I&rsquo;d like). I&rsquo;ve got a couple bike ride reports in the hopper. The walks are a lot less interesting than they were at first (lots of repitition). But they&rsquo;re still happening.
Happy stalking me!

        I modified the hello-friend-ng theme to include Fancy Zoom. It&rsquo;ll mostly be useful on the route maps.

        It&rsquo;s February 2020. Anyone with flimsy resolutions in January has probably already broken them. This is a good time for my ass to get back into a routine.
My excuse through most of last year was that work was getting in the way; too many meetings before 9:00 a.m., and experience has shown that I have to do my gym shit in the morning, or not at all. And since the gym doesn&rsquo;t open until 7:00, that meant not at all.

        Just trying front matter on an _index.md file to see how that looks.
