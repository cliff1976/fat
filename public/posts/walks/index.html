            <p class="note title">Regenstauf to Ramspau and back</p><p class="note date">Saturday, February 27, 2021</p><p class="note content">We drove about 15 minutes north to the town of Regenstauf to shop at Quantum Satis — same as last weekend. This time, we did a longer walk afterwards and brought a pal (newish to Regensburg) along for the shop and chat. It was a nice day for it. The original route would have led us into a hilly, muddy (owing to the rain the previous night), woody area, so we stuck to the road and even went a little farther than expected.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/walks/2021-02-24/">

It was a very foggy morning. Could that be it?

            <p class="note title">Marshy Storchy Regen Riverbanks</p><p class="note date">Saturday, February 20, 2021</p><p class="note content">We took the car up to Regenstauf on a very small shopping trip. We headed specifically to Quantum Satis, packaging-free store. They have a LOT of the stuff we use on a daily basis available in bulk. So even though it costs a lot more (compared to the typical grocery store fare), I&rsquo;d like to start refilling pantry staples from that store, without incurring packaging waste.
Side note: there is another great packaging-free store in downtown Regensburg &ndash; Füllgut (which has a nice pun in its name).<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/walks/2021-01-31/">
            <p class="note title">Loop around the canals</p><p class="note date">Sunday, January 31, 2021</p><p class="note content">Bright sunny day and cold, but not bitterly so. The sun and the activity warmed us up such that a brief stop in the shade (or the wind over the dam) was plenty to cool us down again.
Lots of other people had the same idea &ndash; taking advantage of the weather today. Let&rsquo;s hope that doesn&rsquo;t result in another Corona spike &ndash; the extended lockdown has been working pretty well this time.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/walks/2021-01-19/">
