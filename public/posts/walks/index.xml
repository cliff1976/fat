      <description>I think my phone&amp;rsquo;s GPS was playing a prank on me. This shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been a 7 km walk.

      <description>Last minute decision, kinda, to run over to a buddy&amp;rsquo;s place to pick up some fruit preserves he made and kept for us. Cut it kinda close with regard to the curfew in place due to Regensburg&amp;rsquo;s infection rates.

      <description>Just a Saturday shopping trip on foot. I think the longer the longer you stand around in one place (like while waiting for mantı at Lezizel), the less reliable the GPS readings become.

      <description>Die Spargelzeit, that is.
German asparagus is available at REWE near us. Lass den Spargelwahn krachen.
Snaps That building across the street from REWE and Candis Park is getting bigger everytime I walk by.
Not all of the stuff shown here is domestic or even regional. But at least the white asparagus in the yellow plastic bag is the REWE Regional brand. So it won&amp;rsquo;t be much longer until everyone&amp;rsquo;s griping about the workers imported from Eastern European countries bringing Covid in with them to steal German bikes and not appreciably drop the prices on a Pfund of asparagus.</description>

      <description>Got up way too early today. Why not turn it into a walk? The timezone shift is coming soon; might as well embrace the sunlight.
Snaps The OTH pond was nice and still.
I liked the irony of both a car and a bike swerving onto the sidewalk to drive around the crew applying a Fahrradstrasse sign on the street.

      <description>It was time to donate blood again today.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t get my morning walk in, so I took a three kilometer stroll up to the Jahnstadion after work and got there dreadfully early for my 18:30 appointment. So I kept strolling and killed a little time, padding out my walk to five kilometers.
I had my phone set to mark my position every 30 seconds, and that makes my traversal of the parking lot rows look sloppy.</description>

      <description>We took a walk today instead of my usual Sunday bike ride. We stopped in at Opera in der Prüfeninger Straße and scooped up some (counter-productive) baked goods. It reminded us that we are really looking forward to a time when we can have some Kaffee und Kuchen out at a place like Opera.

      <description>Windy and rainy. But I discovered a bike path to Oberhinkofen near the SE corner of this route, and a BMX &amp;ldquo;Dirtpark&amp;rdquo;, should I ever feel so inclined.
Also gas prices &amp;ndash; WAY UP.

      <description>We drove about 15 minutes north to the town of Regenstauf to shop at Quantum Satis — same as last weekend. This time, we did a longer walk afterwards and brought a pal (newish to Regensburg) along for the shop and chat. It was a nice day for it. The original route would have led us into a hilly, muddy (owing to the rain the previous night), woody area, so we stuck to the road and even went a little farther than expected.</description>

      <description>You think it&amp;rsquo;s walking past the water and electric utility office building that&amp;rsquo;s causing my GPS readings to go nuts, or is it maybe weather-related? It was a very foggy morning. Could that be it?

      <description>We took the car up to Regenstauf on a very small shopping trip. We headed specifically to Quantum Satis, packaging-free store. They have a LOT of the stuff we use on a daily basis available in bulk. So even though it costs a lot more (compared to the typical grocery store fare), I&amp;rsquo;d like to start refilling pantry staples from that store, without incurring packaging waste.
Side note: there is another great packaging-free store in downtown Regensburg &amp;ndash; Füllgut (which has a nice pun in its name).</description>

      <description>Bright sunny day and cold, but not bitterly so. The sun and the activity warmed us up such that a brief stop in the shade (or the wind over the dam) was plenty to cool us down again.
Lots of other people had the same idea &amp;ndash; taking advantage of the weather today. Let&amp;rsquo;s hope that doesn&amp;rsquo;t result in another Corona spike &amp;ndash; the extended lockdown has been working pretty well this time.</description>

      <description>First walk of the year!
Some local pals suggested this route through the woods starting outside of Wenzenbach, heading north. It was very pretty, and would have been quite short, but for the icy trails. Much of it runs parallel to a few creeks, so there was a lot of moisture to contend with &amp;ndash; and much of it had turned to ice.
Notes  need new hiking boots (soles are pretty much gone on mine) consider  buying &amp;ldquo;hiking poles&amp;rdquo; (&amp;quot;Wanderstöcke&amp;quot;) bringing crampons along next time getting a thermos; really could have used a warm beverage, like  hot chocolate tea/coffee Glühwein (make Sarah drive)      Snaps</description>

Frosty trainyard

This was a parking garage less than a year ago.

The mosque is coming along nicely.

Here&amp;rsquo;s another big pit of a construction site.

      <description>It was hovering around freezing, and kinda wet, and that made me nervous about a long bike ride and the potential for a wipe-out, so I opted for a walk instead.
Snaps 
I don&amp;rsquo;t know how long it&amp;rsquo;s been there, but there&amp;rsquo;s a Bucherzelle at the Andreasstadel in Stadtamhof now. Looks like they&amp;rsquo;ve had trouble with people using it improperly. I hope that behavior doesn&amp;rsquo;t doom it.

I walked up to the top of the Dreifaltigkeitsberg.</description>

      <description>I was going to do another shorty 20 or maybe 30km bike ride today, but the weather prediction changed and I decided that if there was a chance of rain and temperatures hovering around freezing, I&amp;rsquo;d rather be on foot. So I did a long walk instead.

      <description>I needed to walk into town to buy some beer and lunchmeat. So I took the long way.
The canal under the Grieser Steg was a pretty shade of green.
When I crossed into Stadtamhof, I saw the Spital brewery is advertising a Halbe Radler with a motorcycling monkey logo. I hope there&amp;rsquo;s an inside joke in there I&amp;rsquo;m just not getting.

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been walking a neighbor dog a couple days a week. I did a nice long one with her on a day when we also did the grocery shopping on foot. So there were almost thirteen that day. I only wore the heart rate monitor for the dog walk part of the day (in red solid lines).

      <description>Sure felt weird doing this Freinsheim walk by myself, and not with any of the usual suspects, or 10,000 other wine and food enthusiasts.

      <description>Scored fresh, local, green asparagus at the Donaumarkt &amp;ndash; grilled it for dinner for the second day in a row. Was a great accompaniment to the Bärlauchrisotto Sarah made.
Desweiteren we went to Tutto Italiano for the first time and found some stuff that Il Mercato does not carry. Including wine from Badia a Coltibuono! What a score!
Two routes, 11.3 km total today:
The splotchy bits are our wanderings inside the Lukullus Polish market on Greflingerstraße and Tutto Italiano and REWE.</description>

      <description>I knew I wanted to talk a long Sunday stroll, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect it would turn into a 10-mile (16-kilometer) multi-hour deal. Got a little sore by the end of it. More pictures on the Regensblog post about it.

      <description>This was the last chance to leave town before the Ausgangsbeschränkung went into effect at midnight tonight, so we took it. We also saw
 where our pal gets all those beautiful mystical forest shots of his dogs, and some ancient Celtic mystery forest stuff [cue the spooky music], and the foundations of an old Roman bathhouse as the ruins from a Villa Rustica  Route:
