            <description>We drove about 15 minutes north to the town of Regenstauf to shop at Quantum Satis — same as last weekend. This time, we did a longer walk afterwards and brought a pal (newish to Regensburg) along for the shop and chat. It was a nice day for it. The original route would have led us into a hilly, muddy (owing to the rain the previous night), woody area, so we stuck to the road and even went a little farther than expected.</description>

            <description>You think it&amp;rsquo;s walking past the water and electric utility office building that&amp;rsquo;s causing my GPS readings to go nuts, or is it maybe weather-related? It was a very foggy morning. Could that be it?

            <description>We took the car up to Regenstauf on a very small shopping trip. We headed specifically to Quantum Satis, packaging-free store. They have a LOT of the stuff we use on a daily basis available in bulk. So even though it costs a lot more (compared to the typical grocery store fare), I&amp;rsquo;d like to start refilling pantry staples from that store, without incurring packaging waste.
Side note: there is another great packaging-free store in downtown Regensburg &amp;ndash; Füllgut (which has a nice pun in its name).</description>

We headed specifically to <a href="https://www.quantum-satis.de/">Quantum Satis</a>, packaging-free store.  They have a LOT of the stuff we use on a daily basis available in bulk.  So even though it costs a lot more (compared to the typical grocery store fare), I&rsquo;d like to start refilling pantry staples from that store, without incurring packaging waste.</p>
<p>Side note:  there is another great packaging-free store in downtown Regensburg &ndash; <a href="https://www.fuellgutregensburg.de/">Füllgut</a> (which has a nice pun in its name).  Same concept, but it&rsquo;s a MUCH smaller store and it always feels kind of cramped to me.  This was not as big a deal pre-Corona.  I visited the store once before, last year, on a bike trip.  I could totally do a bike trip once a week to Quantum Satis to restock on dry goods, transporting a few at a time home in my saddle bag.</p>
<p>After the shopping, we took a walk along some protected wetlands.  Plenty of storks and swans were hanging around, getting their bird stuff on.  When we got back to the car, parked near a bridge over the river, we saw a swan guarding one entire loaf of bread and devouring another.  Watch your carbs, bud.</p>

            <description>Bright sunny day and cold, but not bitterly so. The sun and the activity warmed us up such that a brief stop in the shade (or the wind over the dam) was plenty to cool us down again.
Lots of other people had the same idea &amp;ndash; taking advantage of the weather today. Let&amp;rsquo;s hope that doesn&amp;rsquo;t result in another Corona spike &amp;ndash; the extended lockdown has been working pretty well this time.</description>

<p>Lots of other people had the same idea &ndash; taking advantage of the weather today.  Let&rsquo;s hope that doesn&rsquo;t result in another Corona spike &ndash; the extended lockdown has been working pretty well this time.  We&rsquo;re down to about 30 new infections reported in the last seven days, adjusted for 100,000 inhabitants.  In fact, there were so many other people enjoying the south bank of the Danube that we cut into some parks on the way back; there were lots fewer people on those paths than directly along the river.</p>

            <description>First walk of the year!
Some local pals suggested this route through the woods starting outside of Wenzenbach, heading north. It was very pretty, and would have been quite short, but for the icy trails. Much of it runs parallel to a few creeks, so there was a lot of moisture to contend with &amp;ndash; and much of it had turned to ice.

            <description>Frost! First overnight one of the season, I think. I spotted frozen puddles in places on my walk this morning.
Snaps Donkey Republic bikes not far from home!

Frosty trainyard

This was a parking garage less than a year ago.

The mosque is coming along nicely.

Here&amp;rsquo;s another big pit of a construction site.

Philosophical graffiti:

Is it a peaceful place to work or not?</description>

            <description>It was hovering around freezing, and kinda wet, and that made me nervous about a long bike ride and the potential for a wipe-out, so I opted for a walk instead.
Snaps 
I don&amp;rsquo;t know how long it&amp;rsquo;s been there, but there&amp;rsquo;s a Bucherzelle at the Andreasstadel in Stadtamhof now. Looks like they&amp;rsquo;ve had trouble with people using it improperly. I hope that behavior doesn&amp;rsquo;t doom it.

I walked up to the top of the Dreifaltigkeitsberg.</description>

I walked up to the top of the <em>Dreifaltigkeitsberg</em>.  This shot is from about two-thirds from the top.  I liked the straight line to the cathedral.</p>

After crossing onto the islands, I saw the biggest police boat I&rsquo;ve ever seen on the Danube.  I wonder if they were out patrolling for face mask violators, just like all the squad cars and paddy wagons we&rsquo;ve seen recently.</p>

On the fourth Sunday of advent, this place is supposed to be jam-packed with eaters, drinkers, and shoppers.  I have a feeling &ldquo;jam-packed&rdquo; was always going to be a no-go this year, and maybe for more than a few years to come.  But I also have a feeling that more diligence and national cohesion of policy would have allowed Christmas markets to have opened with moderate restrictions in place and prevented this nearly complete <em>Weihnachtsmarktverbot</em>.  I kinda wish there were none at all &ndash; just skipping it this year &ndash; instead of these sad little displays.  Of course, my financial survival is not linked to a Christmas market happening or not.</p>

            <description>I was going to do another shorty 20 or maybe 30km bike ride today, but the weather prediction changed and I decided that if there was a chance of rain and temperatures hovering around freezing, I&amp;rsquo;d rather be on foot. So I did a long walk instead.
Snaps Got a new sweatshirt for my recent birthday from my parents. That thing is warm. Was great today for this long, dreary walk.</description>

            <description>I needed to walk into town to buy some beer and lunchmeat. So I took the long way.
The canal under the Grieser Steg was a pretty shade of green.
When I crossed into Stadtamhof, I saw the Spital brewery is advertising a Halbe Radler with a motorcycling monkey logo. I hope there&amp;rsquo;s an inside joke in there I&amp;rsquo;m just not getting.

            <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been walking a neighbor dog a couple days a week. I did a nice long one with her on a day when we also did the grocery shopping on foot. So there were almost thirteen that day. I only wore the heart rate monitor for the dog walk part of the day (in red solid lines).

            <description>Scored fresh, local, green asparagus at the Donaumarkt &amp;ndash; grilled it for dinner for the second day in a row. Was a great accompaniment to the Bärlauchrisotto Sarah made.
Desweiteren we went to Tutto Italiano for the first time and found some stuff that Il Mercato does not carry. Including wine from Badia a Coltibuono! What a score!
Two routes, 11.3 km total today:
The splotchy bits are our wanderings inside the Lukullus Polish market on Greflingerstraße and Tutto Italiano and REWE.</description>

            <description>I knew I wanted to talk a long Sunday stroll, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect it would turn into a 10-mile (16-kilometer) multi-hour deal. Got a little sore by the end of it. More pictures on the Regensblog post about it.
