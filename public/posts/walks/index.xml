      <description>We drove about 15 minutes north to the town of Regenstauf to shop at Quantum Satis — same as last weekend. This time, we did a longer walk afterwards and brought a pal (newish to Regensburg) along for the shop and chat. It was a nice day for it. The original route would have led us into a hilly, muddy (owing to the rain the previous night), woody area, so we stuck to the road and even went a little farther than expected.</description>

      <description>You think it&amp;rsquo;s walking past the water and electric utility office building that&amp;rsquo;s causing my GPS readings to go nuts, or is it maybe weather-related? It was a very foggy morning. Could that be it?

      <description>I like that I can be awake and out for a walk around the time the start starts his day, too.

      <description>We took the car up to Regenstauf on a very small shopping trip. We headed specifically to Quantum Satis, packaging-free store. They have a LOT of the stuff we use on a daily basis available in bulk. So even though it costs a lot more (compared to the typical grocery store fare), I&amp;rsquo;d like to start refilling pantry staples from that store, without incurring packaging waste.
Side note: there is another great packaging-free store in downtown Regensburg &amp;ndash; Füllgut (which has a nice pun in its name).</description>

      <description>Bright sunny day and cold, but not bitterly so. The sun and the activity warmed us up such that a brief stop in the shade (or the wind over the dam) was plenty to cool us down again.
Lots of other people had the same idea &amp;ndash; taking advantage of the weather today. Let&amp;rsquo;s hope that doesn&amp;rsquo;t result in another Corona spike &amp;ndash; the extended lockdown has been working pretty well this time.</description>

      <description>First walk of the year!
Some local pals suggested this route through the woods starting outside of Wenzenbach, heading north. It was very pretty, and would have been quite short, but for the icy trails. Much of it runs parallel to a few creeks, so there was a lot of moisture to contend with &amp;ndash; and much of it had turned to ice.
Notes  need new hiking boots (soles are pretty much gone on mine) consider  buying &amp;ldquo;hiking poles&amp;rdquo; (&amp;quot;Wanderstöcke&amp;quot;) bringing crampons along next time getting a thermos; really could have used a warm beverage, like  hot chocolate tea/coffee Glühwein (make Sarah drive)      Snaps</description>

      <description>Frost! First overnight one of the season, I think. I spotted frozen puddles in places on my walk this morning.
Snaps Donkey Republic bikes not far from home!

Frosty trainyard

This was a parking garage less than a year ago.

The mosque is coming along nicely.

Here&amp;rsquo;s another big pit of a construction site.

      <description>It was hovering around freezing, and kinda wet, and that made me nervous about a long bike ride and the potential for a wipe-out, so I opted for a walk instead.
Snaps 
I don&amp;rsquo;t know how long it&amp;rsquo;s been there, but there&amp;rsquo;s a Bucherzelle at the Andreasstadel in Stadtamhof now. Looks like they&amp;rsquo;ve had trouble with people using it improperly. I hope that behavior doesn&amp;rsquo;t doom it.

I walked up to the top of the Dreifaltigkeitsberg.</description>

      <description>I was going to do another shorty 20 or maybe 30km bike ride today, but the weather prediction changed and I decided that if there was a chance of rain and temperatures hovering around freezing, I&amp;rsquo;d rather be on foot. So I did a long walk instead.
Snaps Got a new sweatshirt for my recent birthday from my parents. That thing is warm. Was great today for this long, dreary walk.</description>

      <description>I needed to walk into town to buy some beer and lunchmeat. So I took the long way.
The canal under the Grieser Steg was a pretty shade of green.

When I crossed into Stadtamhof, I saw the Spital brewery is advertising a Halbe Radler with a motorcycling monkey logo. I hope there&amp;rsquo;s an inside joke in there I&amp;rsquo;m just not getting.

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been walking a neighbor dog a couple days a week. I did a nice long one with her on a day when we also did the grocery shopping on foot. So there were almost thirteen that day. I only wore the heart rate monitor for the dog walk part of the day (in red solid lines).

      <description>Scored fresh, local, green asparagus at the Donaumarkt &amp;ndash; grilled it for dinner for the second day in a row. Was a great accompaniment to the Bärlauchrisotto Sarah made.

Desweiteren we went to Tutto Italiano for the first time and found some stuff that Il Mercato does not carry. Including wine from Badia a Coltibuono! What a score!
Two routes, 11.3 km total today:

The splotchy bits are our wanderings inside the Lukullus Polish market on Greflingerstraße and Tutto Italiano and REWE.</description>
