Some local pals suggested this route through the woods starting outside of Wenzenbach, heading north. It was very pretty, and would have been quite short, but for the icy trails. Much of it runs parallel to a few creeks, so there was a lot of moisture to contend with &ndash; and much of it had turned to ice.
Notes  need new hiking boots (soles are pretty much gone on mine) consider  buying &ldquo;hiking poles&rdquo; (&quot;Wanderstöcke&quot;) bringing crampons along next time getting a thermos; really could have used a warm beverage, like  hot chocolate tea/coffee Glühwein (make Sarah drive)      Snaps<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/walks/2020-12-30/">

This was a parking garage less than a year ago.

The mosque is coming along nicely.

Here&rsquo;s another big pit of a construction site.

I don&rsquo;t know how long it&rsquo;s been there, but there&rsquo;s a Bucherzelle at the Andreasstadel in Stadtamhof now. Looks like they&rsquo;ve had trouble with people using it improperly. I hope that behavior doesn&rsquo;t doom it.

I walked up to the top of the Dreifaltigkeitsberg.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/walks/2020-12-15/">

The canal under the Grieser Steg was a pretty shade of green.

When I crossed into Stadtamhof, I saw the Spital brewery is advertising a Halbe Radler with a motorcycling monkey logo. I hope there&rsquo;s an inside joke in there I&rsquo;m just not getting.
