<h1>Secret Flugplatz!</h1>

  <p>Sep 13, 2020</p>




<p>Well, secret to me, anyways.  I didn&rsquo;t know it was there.  I woke up just before 6, got my coffee on, and was out on the road at 7:45.  I&rsquo;ve started a couple bikerides this year intending to make it all the way to Kallmünz.  Today was another of those that fell short.  Not that the ride wasn&rsquo;t fulfilling.  I didn&rsquo;t know there was a <em>Flugplatz</em> in Oberhub, so I detoured even more up a hill to check it out.  It was apparently active, because a half an hour while taking a water break on top of another hill several kilometers away I saw a plane take off from it.</p>
<p>That <em>Flugplatz</em> distracted me from my original route and I continued on to Schnepfenberg instead of bearing northwest towards Oberhub and, ultimately Kallmünz.  I turned south at Buchenlohe, cruised through Hohenwarth, and then tried a shortcut through a forest west of Steinsberg.  Not a good idea.  I backtracked and finally came back down onto paved roads for the rest of the trip.  Note well:  I hit 54 km/h on the hill headed south out of the <em>Schwaighauser Forst</em> on R15 towards Kaulhausen!</p>
<p>The snaps!</p>
<p>It was cool this morning and I was happy to get into the sun.<br>

<p>Most of the climb on the first half of the trip was fairly gentle.<br>

<p><em>Flugplatz?</em>  Baroo?<br>

<p>Then a whole lotta farmland after missing my turn towards Kallmünz.

<p>Tried to short-cut it through some woods.  Bad idea.  Had to backtrack.  Did not escape fully unscathed.<br>

<p>But that did not dampen my spirits.<br>

<p>And when I got back into town, I saw that tour groups are running again, to my surprise.  Lots of chin-masking there.  They looked like river cruisers, but there were no ships in port that I saw, so I wonder if that was a bus group.
