Baroo?\nThen a whole lotta farmland after missing my turn towards Kallmünz. Tried to short-cut it through some woods. Bad idea. Had to backtrack. Did not escape fully unscathed.\nBut that did not dampen my spirits.\nAnd when I got back into town, I saw that tour groups are running again, to my surprise. Lots of chin-masking there. They looked like river cruisers, but there were no ships in port that I saw, so I wonder if that was a bus group.
