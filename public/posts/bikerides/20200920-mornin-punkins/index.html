<p>No denying it &ndash; autumn is here, at least a day or two early.  You can see it in the produce.</p>
<p>I had mapped out a nice route of nearly exactly 50 km, heading south on our street to Oberhinkofen, and then turning west towards Teugn to come up into Bad Abbach from the south, but &hellip; <em>something was amiss in the state of Denmark,</em> if you know what I mean, and given that it was a Sunday morning before 9:00, and <em>nothing</em> was going to be open, I opted to head into Bad Abbach from the east and headed home from there.  Still turned out to be almost 35 km, and I&rsquo;m fine with that.</p>
<p>The snaps!</p>
<p>There were three or four patches like this along my route.<br>

<p>Someday I&rsquo;d like to stop at either of these restaurants / <em>Biergarten</em> and see how those places are.  Can anyone vouch for them?  Get in touch with me, please.  Gastst√§tte Vocht (an Asian restaurant):

<p>These sheep didn&rsquo;t seem to mind the weather, but I kinda did.  I was a little cold for the first time since, like, March!
