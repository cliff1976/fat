I started off crossing the Danube at Kleinprüfening.  Notice the water level.  This was warning sign #1 and will be important later.</p>

I got all the way up the hill above Eilsbrunn (home of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastst%C3%A4tte_R%C3%B6hrl"><em>Gaststätte Röhrl</em></a>, the oldest continuously operating restaurant in the world, according to the Guinness Book of Records.  I&rsquo;ve eaten there a few times.  It&rsquo;s good.) before taking a break.  That hill was serious.</p>
<p><img src="/IMG_20210206_110753617_s.jpg" alt=""><br>
Zooming down from there towards Hardt was fun.  But then I got back up another hill almost right away and a weird plateau farmy place.</p>

What is this house built into a mound with low-slooping rooves (hi Susie) and solar panels out in the middle of a field?</p>

Here is where things started to go <em>schief</em>.  My planned route had me climb from Saxberg to Bergmatting (warning sign #2:  &ldquo;<em>Anything</em>-berg-<em>anything</em>&quot;) through some woods to lead me to the ferry at Matting to cross the Danube and have a nice easy stretch of riverlands back towards Regensburg with optional final hilly bits leading up into Pentling and Graß.  Boy, was I optimistic.  &ldquo;Through some woods&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t really describe it.</p>

Holy crap.  That is a heckuva slope on foot, let alone on a bike.  And mine is a city bike.  And beneath these soggy leaves is modeling-clay mud.  I painstakingly traversed the mountainside, skidding and sliding with a bike in-tow.</p>
<p><img src="/IMG_20210206_122430123_s.jpg" alt=""><br>
I walked my bike down several hundred meters of this slope, thinking &ldquo;well, this stinks, but just get to the ferry and you can take it easy the rest of the way home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in the end I completely lost my footing and scooted the last 50 feet on my butt.  My bike came along behind me and then <em>over</em> me, bonking me on the head in the process.  So, we know my helmet works.</p>
<p>I found a sign at the entrance to the &ldquo;path&rdquo; that read something to the effect of &ldquo;you will be fined if you deviate from the path.&rdquo;  I challenge that sign publisher to identify the path.</p>
<p><img src="/IMG_20210206_123602609_s.jpg" alt=""><br>
Hopes and dreams dashed.  The ferry is closed due to high water.</p>

Biking through a golf course so close to the end of that nightmarish mudslide just pissed me off.  I was so tired after skidding down that hill on foot that it took me several hours longer than planned for about the same overall distance traveled.</p>
<p><img src="/dirt_pants.jpeg" alt=""><br>
It was not until I got home that I could see how much of that mountain came along with me.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I gotta say, I&rsquo;m impressed that the mounts and cases for my camera and phone protected my gear so well.  Both were completely unscatched, even though they were caked in mud on the outside.</p>

<p>You might need to tap or click the map to make it bigger.  The red solid route was my intention.  The blue dashed route is my actual route.</p>
