That hill is a beast. Today I took a water and Schüttelbrot break in the bus shelter just outside the Prösslbräu grounds (and&hellip;good to know that there is bus service up there; that brewery makes delicious things).<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/bikerides/20210221-guggisee/">

It never got there. I delayed the start of my ride as much as I could, hoping for sunny skies and warmer temperatures, and while I didn&rsquo;t get rained on, I never saw the sun after all.

And I bike to/from it frequently enough. The position of the town lends itself to round trips, whether I&rsquo;m feeling bergy or flussy.
Today&rsquo;s route was supposed to trace the Danube back more of the way home, but even before the halfway point at — you guessed it! — Bad Abbach, my feet were hurting from the cold. So at Großprüfening I cut it short.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/bikerides/20210206-sinzing-ring/">

I started off crossing the Danube at Kleinprüfening. Notice the water level. This was warning sign #1 and will be important later.


I got all the way up the hill above Eilsbrunn (home of Gaststätte Röhrl, the oldest continuously operating restaurant in the world, according to the Guinness Book of Records. I&rsquo;ve eaten there a few times. It&rsquo;s good.) before taking a break. That hill was serious.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/bikerides/20210110-baiern/">
            <p class="note title">to Baiern</p><p class="note date">Sunday, January 10, 2021</p><p class="note content">First ride of the year! I&rsquo;d taken a couple weekends off, which stretched out to over a month, because I was worried about the moisture on the ground and the wintry temperatures resulting in icy conditions. I tried to walk more in the meantime. That kinda worked, but not as much as I&rsquo;d hoped.
I thought it was a little weird to leave Regensburg and cross into Baiern. I mean the standard local historical thing is that Regensburg was a free imperial city for a long time and by crossing the Danube into Stadtamhof, one was leaving Regensburg and entering Bavaria (Bayern).<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/bikerides/20201206-donau-park/">
            <p class="note title">Around Donau Park</p><p class="note date">Sunday, December 6, 2020</p><p class="note content">After last week&rsquo;s flat Danube odyssey, I thought I could probably handle at least the uphill bits on the way to Pentling and bask in the river bank&rsquo;s flat glory on my way back — especially since I didn&rsquo;t feel like a three-hour tour (a three-hour tour) today, and chopped my route down to a mere 20 km.
I was right in theory; but in practice, GraphHopper picked a route for me right up a tractor track between a couple of fields, which was steeper than I expected.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/bikerides/20201130-flatter-to-pfatter/">
            <p class="note title">Flatter to Pfatter</p><p class="note date">Monday, November 30, 2020</p><p class="note content">It&rsquo;s cold enough now for a full-on winter jacket out there, thus the attire switch.
I thought I would give the ol' quadriceps a break and stick to some very level terrain. You can&rsquo;t go wrong with following the Danube for a nice, level ride. I still managed to take a wrong turn or two, but I never had to backtrack. In a couple places along my route, it&rsquo;s not obvious whether a biker should go left or right to stay on a path.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/bikerides/20201122-still-no-kallmuenz/">
            <p class="note title">Still no Kallmünz</p><p class="note date">Sunday, November 22, 2020</p><p class="note content">Ever since this dang pandemic hit and I began exploring the region on my bike, I&rsquo;ve been itching to bike up to Kallmünz and back. One thing or another hat foiled each of my attempts. I took another shot at it today. Foiled again.
 I got off to a weak start just north of Stadtamhof at the Dreifaltigkeitsberg. A one-lane road shared with cars in both directions is daunting enough on its own.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/bikerides/20201108-victory-loop-foiled/">
            <p class="note title">Victory Loop Foiled by Construction</p><p class="note date">Sunday, November 8, 2020</p><p class="note content">I thought I&rsquo;d take a victory loop after the momentous occasions of late. I carefully mapped my route using GraphHopper and thought I was good-to-go for a route mostly following three rivers
 Danube Naab Schwarze Laber  &hellip; with a little hilliness in the middle to keep it interesting. The stretch up the hill from Etterzhausen to Nittendorf was a slog, but I knew that was coming, and I thought perhaps I&rsquo;d progressed in my endurance such that it wouldn&rsquo;t kill me.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/bikerides/20201101-daredevil-chicken/">

 Note to self: remember that the camera has no internal battery and you have to set the date and time with every battery change!
I took a suggestion from local pal Markus and went out southwest towards Mangolding, Mintraching and Geisling. Those were new towns for me, but the route back along the B8 through Barbing was old hat. Pretty flat the whole way, so it should have been a good opportunity to keep my heart rate low and steady.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li></ul><div class="pagination">
