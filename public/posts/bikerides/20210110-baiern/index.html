<h1>to Baiern</h1>

  <p>Jan 10, 2021</p>




<p>First ride of the year!  I&rsquo;d taken a couple weekends off, which stretched out
to over a month, because I was worried about the moisture on the ground and the
wintry temperatures resulting in icy conditions.  I tried to walk more in
the meantime.  That kinda worked, but not as much as I&rsquo;d hoped.</p>
<p>I thought it was a little weird to leave Regensburg and cross into Baiern.  I mean the standard local historical thing is that Regensburg was a free imperial city for a long time and by crossing the Danube into Stadtamhof, one was leaving Regensburg and entering Bavaria (<em>Bayern</em>).  But I crossed the municipal limits into a town called <em>Baiern</em>.  It seems there are a whole mess of these:  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayern_(Begriffskl%C3%A4rung)">https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayern_(Begriffskl%C3%A4rung)</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Today was the first time back in the saddle, so I chose a route that I thought
the ol' cheeks could handle — just 25ish km.  I goofed up a little around
Lappersdorf and had to backtrack a bit.  And I opted to head back home via the
Nibelungenbrücke instead of cutting through the Altstadt, which would have
obligated me to wear a mask.  And they are getting <em>serious</em> about enforcement
(rightly so!).  So, bonus.</p>

<p>Just one of me today.  You can watch the video if you like.  The snow around 10:30 a.m. was kinda pretty, but the rest of it is quite gray and drab.</p>
