<h1>Running up that hill...towards Bad Abbach again</h1>


  </p>



  
  

  <p>May 1, 2020</p>




<p>It started out another beautiful day.  Didn&rsquo;t stick.  Thought I&rsquo;d conquer that hill through the woods outside Leoprechting.  Nope!  Had to push my bike for a lot of it.  At least partly that&rsquo;s because the dirt track had turned into mud and a tractor chewed it up real good 5 minutes before me.</p>
<p>I rode past the <del>Continental</del> Arena and then through a field (didn&rsquo;t like that so much; felt like trespassing), towards Leoprechting, onto Niedergebraching <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, and the clouds were ominous.  I thought I would be lucky and my route would take me around the edge of the rainy patch of sky.  When I finally reached the outskirts of Bad Abbach, I got rained on pretty good there, so I ducked into a parking shelter and waited out the worst of it.</p>
<p>I hauled ass on the way back because I was cold and wet.  By the time I got home, I was dry, but still cold.  I fell asleep in the tub.</p>
