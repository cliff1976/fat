        <p>It&rsquo;s been a couple weeks (weather and general life happening), but the weather was supposed to be great today (and it was), so I wanted to take advantage of it.  A couple weekends ago our pal <em>Special K</em> came up to visit and brought her bike.  That Saturday it rained like God had decided on a Do-Over, but there was a pottery market happening at Kloster Adlersberg.  I thought that would be a nice bike destination under decent weather conditions, and I was right.</p>
<p>The snaps:</p>
<p>The <em>Eiserner Brücke</em> has been temporarily renamed after Michael Buschheuer, the founder of the <a href="https://sea-eye.org/">Sea-Eye</a> Mediterranean rescue organization HQ&rsquo;d in Regensburg:<br>
<img src="/IMG_20200906_083409979_s.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The Danube was very peaceful this morning before 9:00 a.m.<br>
<img src="/IMG_20200906_084705973_HDR_s.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I turned north about 3/4 of the way to Mariaort and headed towards Adlersberg.<br>
<img src="/IMG_20200906_090130719_s.jpg" alt="">
<img src="/IMG_20200906_090323577_s.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Honestly I could have gone for a beer and a plate of cheese and a few sausages right then upon arrival, and they looked ready for me, but not a creature was stirring.<br>
<img src="/IMG_20200906_090825758_s.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>So I admired the view and the ride down into the valley.<br>
<img src="/IMG_20200906_091221701_HDR_s.jpg" alt="">
<img src="/IMG_20200906_091920677_HDR_s.jpg" alt="">
<img src="/IMG_20200906_092140868_HDR_s.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I took a break at the Naab and watched a rowing crew obey the sing-songy stroke orders through a megaphone as they propelled themselves upstream.<br>
<img src="/IMG_20200906_093718880_s.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I continued along the train tracks, crossing the Danube too, and made my way south towards Matting.  I realized I missed my turn-off at Unterirading and tried to short-cut my way through the woods.  That did not work so well and I wore myself out getting up the hill on the off-road paths.  I had to push my bike for a few hundred meters until I got back onto a gravel-paved path and continued toward Niedergebraching, and my old arch-enemy Großberg.  This time I made it all the way up to the top of Großberg without stopping, but it was a slog.  At least everything from Ziegetsdorf back home was an easy coast.</p>
<p><img src="/IMG_20200906_095831251_s.jpg" alt="">
<img src="/IMG_20200906_101149899_s.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I especially liked the irony of the half-torn off &ldquo;stickers forbidden&rdquo; sticker on the post with all the other stickers on it.<br>
