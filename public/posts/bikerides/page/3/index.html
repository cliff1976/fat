            <p class="note title">Finally beat that hill!</p><p class="note date">Sunday, May 24, 2020</p><p class="note content">Well, sorta. I cheated by telling my GPS to route me only on paved routes, which obviated huffing and puffing up the muddy hill.
It was not another beautiful day. It started off with ominous clouds, that were true omens, because the hail they pelted me with stung. But at least not for long. By the time I got to my destination (delivering a borrowed item back to its owner), I was dry again and the sun warmed me back up.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/bikerides/20200516-its-right-there-in-the-name/">
            <p class="note title">It's right there in the name!</p><p class="note date">Saturday, May 16, 2020</p><p class="note content">Another beautiful day. I mostly followed the R9 from the Landkreis Regensburg. 1
I think I need to accept that the difficulty level listed as medium by the Landkreis does not (yet) match up to my expectations for medium. OTOH, I neglected to notice a town called &ldquo;Großberg&rdquo; on the itinerary. Duh!
I actually rode a little further than the route suggests; I forgot to start recording my GPX track until I was already up the hill at Bajuwarenstraße.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/bikerides/20200509-kuern-around-bright-eyes/">
            <p class="note title">Kürn Around Bright Eyes</p><p class="note date">Saturday, May 9, 2020</p><p class="note content">Another beautiful day. I mostly followed the Schlössertour from the Landkreis Regensburg. 1
The first leg was on the west bank of the Regen up to Regenstauf. I&rsquo;d done that before. Very nice and level.
The new bits started at Ramspau. It got lots more challenging from that point on. I thought it would be done with at Kürn, but nope. The path was sometimes paved, sometimes supposed to be paved, but under construction, and sometimes forest trail.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/bikerides/20200504-to-wolfsegg-and-back/">
            <p class="note title">to Wolfsegg and Back</p><p class="note date">Monday, May 4, 2020</p><p class="note content">Another beautiful day. At least at the start of it — the clouds rolled in towards the end of my ride.
The rivery parts along the Naab all the way up to Pielenhofen and the monastery on the river were nice and gentle. I took a little water and banana break there. But that&rsquo;s where it started to get demanding. Just outside of Wall I thought to myself
 This is an appropriately-named hamlet.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/bikerides/20200501-runnin-up-that-hill/">
            <p class="note title">Running up that hill...towards Bad Abbach again</p><p class="note date">Friday, May 1, 2020</p><p class="note content">It started out another beautiful day. Didn&rsquo;t stick. Thought I&rsquo;d conquer that hill through the woods outside Leoprechting. Nope! Had to push my bike for a lot of it. At least partly that&rsquo;s because the dirt track had turned into mud and a tractor chewed it up real good 5 minutes before me.
I rode past the Continental Arena and then through a field (didn&rsquo;t like that so much; felt like trespassing), towards Leoprechting, onto Niedergebraching 1, and the clouds were ominous.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/bikerides/20200428-berhardswald-loop/">
            <p class="note title">Bernhardswald Loop</p><p class="note date">Tuesday, April 28, 2020</p><p class="note content">Another beautiful day.
I thought by doing another few dozen kilometers today after just doing it on Sunday I would feel less sore, and build up some butt callouses.
Nope! But it was a nice ride anyways. The part of the Regensburg-Falkenstein bike route on an old train track was great and deserves more attention. The bit through the Kreuther Forst was a bit much going up, but coming down above the Donaustauf Klinik was nice.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/bikerides/20200426-pfatter-not-fatter/">
            <p class="note title">Pfatter, Not Fatter</p><p class="note date">Sunday, April 26, 2020</p><p class="note content">Another beautiful day.
I&rsquo;ve seen the Donau Radweg route signs for 16 years, but I never followed them outside of town.
I rode towards work, took the Osttangente / Odessaring bridge to the baseball stadium, started tracing the Danube right away. But it didn&rsquo;t last too long, jutting south of Tegernheim and catching back up to the river bank about two thirds of the way to Donaustauf.
About half way through, my butt started hurting, so I took an inland shortcut instead of following the last Danube curve towards the bridge outside Pfatter, and then opted for the straighter inland route back into Regensburg, past IKEA and work again.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/bikerides/20200422-kurzarbeit-rivery-loop/">
            <p class="note title">Kurzarbeit Rivery Loop </p><p class="note date">Wednesday, April 22, 2020</p><p class="note content">Another beautiful day, and one mandated off work. Thanks, Corona.
My brain still woke me up at workday time, so why not make a bike ride of it? It was kind of cold for just shorts and a teesh, but I figured that&rsquo;s motivation for me to keep moving. Right in the first 10 minutes I spotted two old pals, one of whom has a new doggy, &ldquo;Spock&rdquo;. That was along the Danube.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/bikerides/20200418_saturday_bad_abbach_loop/">
            <p class="note title">Saturday Bad Abbach Loop</p><p class="note date">Saturday, April 18, 2020</p><p class="note content">Another beautiful day — well, at the beginning. By the end of my ride, the clouds started looming and threatening rain, but I got home before that started. And it blew over anyways.
I had worried about two things:
  Headed south out of Regensburg is a more direct route, but getting up those hills and down in to Bad Abbach would be a real pain.
  The ferry at Matting would be closed due to Corona stuff.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/bikerides/20200412_easter-sunday/">
