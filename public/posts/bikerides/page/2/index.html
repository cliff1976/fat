            <p class="note title">Down one side and back up the other</p><p class="note date">Sunday, October 25, 2020</p><p class="note content">I biked up the hill to Pentling (hey! The bridge over the A3 is open again!) and down the hill from there towards Matting where I met up with my pal Sam for lunch. Then we took the ferry across (1€ per person) to the west (north?) bank of the Danube towards Bad Abbach, where we crossed it again using the bridge there. That&rsquo;s where we parted ways; I headed back downstream (north/east) towards Regensburg.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/bikerides/20201018-october-ride/">
            <p class="note title">October Ride</p><p class="note date">Sunday, October 18, 2020</p><p class="note content">First time back in the saddle after about a month, and it is no longer Panama Jack helmet weather. Also, when I got started this morning, it was foggy as heck, so I through on an eye-catching vest just for good measure. After about 30 minutes, it wasn&rsquo;t really necessary anymore &ndash; the sun burned off the low-hanging clouds.
I stuck to a very familiar route, since I haven&rsquo;t been on the bike in about a month.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/bikerides/20200920-mornin-punkins/">
            <p class="note title">Mornin', punkins!</p><p class="note date">Sunday, September 20, 2020</p><p class="note content">No denying it &ndash; autumn is here, at least a day or two early. You can see it in the produce.
I had mapped out a nice route of nearly exactly 50 km, heading south on our street to Oberhinkofen, and then turning west towards Teugn to come up into Bad Abbach from the south, but &hellip; something was amiss in the state of Denmark, if you know what I mean, and given that it was a Sunday morning before 9:00, and nothing was going to be open, I opted to head into Bad Abbach from the east and headed home from there.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/bikerides/20200913-secret-flugplatz/">
            <p class="note title">Secret Flugplatz!</p><p class="note date">Sunday, September 13, 2020</p><p class="note content">Well, secret to me, anyways. I didn&rsquo;t know it was there. I woke up just before 6, got my coffee on, and was out on the road at 7:45. I&rsquo;ve started a couple bikerides this year intending to make it all the way to Kallmünz. Today was another of those that fell short. Not that the ride wasn&rsquo;t fulfilling. I didn&rsquo;t know there was a Flugplatz in Oberhub, so I detoured even more up a hill to check it out.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/bikerides/20200906-proesslbraeu-matting-and-back/">
            <p class="note title">To Prösslbräu, Matting, and Back</p><p class="note date">Sunday, September 6, 2020</p><p class="note content">It&rsquo;s been a couple weeks (weather and general life happening), but the weather was supposed to be great today (and it was), so I wanted to take advantage of it. A couple weekends ago our pal Special K came up to visit and brought her bike. That Saturday it rained like God had decided on a Do-Over, but there was a pottery market happening at Kloster Adlersberg. I thought that would be a nice bike destination under decent weather conditions, and I was right.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/bikerides/20200816-loch-ellmau/">
            <p class="note title">Loch LMAO</p><p class="note date">Sunday, August 16, 2020</p><p class="note content">After last week&rsquo;s 60+km record breaker, I toned it back down again to 50ish today. I thought I would treat myself to some nice flat stretches along a river for the last leg. I am not so sure that is the right approach; &ldquo;mostly flat&rdquo; is &ldquo;partly hilly&rdquo; and even where truly flat, I was tired of being in the saddle, and mad at friction for forcing me to keep pedaling.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/bikerides/20200809_was-it-woerth-it/">
            <p class="note title">Was it Wörth it?</p><p class="note date">Sunday, August 9, 2020</p><p class="note content">I was pretty sure I don&rsquo;t like rides over 50 km in length. Walking the next day is a real pain. But those 50ish km rides have all been with a mixture of terrain. So I thought I would try a longer — but flatter — ride along the Danube today. I rode from our house to Wörth an der Donau and back.
Guess what? The knees are a little better off for it, but DA BUTT is not.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/bikerides/20200726-dog-scared-me-off/">
            <p class="note title">Dog Scared Me Off</p><p class="note date">Sunday, July 26, 2020</p><p class="note content">I&rsquo;ve been doing my rides mostly on the weekends, since Kurzarbeit is over for me now. I&rsquo;ve been lazy about posting them, but less lazy about actually doing them. So that&rsquo;s good.
In my last post, I picked GraphHopper.com as a mapping service, but I&rsquo;m wary of it now. This time it routed me through a farm at the top of a long, slow hill at Aignhof&hellip; and a Rottweiler-looking dog was quite angry at my presence.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/bikerides/20200628-laaber-and-back/">
            <p class="note title">Laaber and Back</p><p class="note date">Sunday, June 28, 2020</p><p class="note content">Kurzarbeit tomorrow &ndash; presumably the last one for this round of economic crises (or, let&rsquo;s hope so anyways). I had an important week at work last week, so to be there for all of it, I opted to make my last Kurzabeit day of the month the last Monday of the month instead of Friday.
I planned out my route using GraphHopper.com &ndash; first time using that service, but I am sure I&rsquo;ll be back.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/bikerides/20200529-flattening-the-curve/">
            <p class="note title">Flattening the Curve</p><p class="note date">Friday, May 29, 2020</p><p class="note content">Kurzarbeit again today. I decided not to torture myself with a mountainous bike ride, but instead stick to a flat loop out south and east of town. This was along the R7 route recommended by the Landkreis Regensburg.

I messed up my own GPX track recording on this one, forgetting to separate this track from an aborted one on Wednesday, which explains the teleportation from home to the Ostbahnhof area.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li></ul><div class="pagination">
