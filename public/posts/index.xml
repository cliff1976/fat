      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m trying out the PaperMod theme for Hugo. I like the cut of its gib. I might break some stuff while fiddling with it a bit.</description>

      <description>Lest ye fret: I&amp;rsquo;m still here, and still walking and biking (though not as consistently as I&amp;rsquo;d like). I&amp;rsquo;ve got a couple bike ride reports in the hopper. The walks are a lot less interesting than they were at first (lots of repitition). But they&amp;rsquo;re still happening.
Happy stalking me!</description>

      <description>I modified the hello-friend-ng theme to include Fancy Zoom. It&amp;rsquo;ll mostly be useful on the route maps.</description>

      <title>Gettin&#39; Back Up on the Horse</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s February 2020. Anyone with flimsy resolutions in January has probably already broken them. This is a good time for my ass to get back into a routine.
My excuse through most of last year was that work was getting in the way; too many meetings before 9:00 a.m., and experience has shown that I have to do my gym shit in the morning, or not at all. And since the gym doesn&amp;rsquo;t open until 7:00, that meant not at all.</description>
