      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s February 2020. Anyone with flimsy resolutions in January has probably already broken them. This is a good time for my ass to get back into a routine.
My excuse through most of last year was that work was getting in the way; too many meetings before 9:00 a.m., and experience has shown that I have to do my gym shit in the morning, or not at all. And since the gym doesn&amp;rsquo;t open until 7:00, that meant not at all.</description>
