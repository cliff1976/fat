The weather had been so, *mercurial*, shall we say.  Work stuff pressing on relentlessly and cool rainy nights actually helped me sleep better than usual (at least as of late).  All of that meant precious few morning or evening walks this week &mdash; not good.  So during a break in the early evening downpours yesterday, I went for a fast loop.  I managed to keep my heart rate down pretty well.
