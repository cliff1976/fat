title: 2nd try for Adlersberg; still hampered by rain

The universe does not want to make it easy for me to get to Adlersberg on my bike.  I tried the same route as last time, getting this further this time before hitting the rain, and a detour for construction on the bike path forced me up a much steeper hill.  I sought refuge in a bus shelter outside the monastery / brewery before continuing on an abbreviate route back home.

And in case there was any doubt -- the tour boats and busses have returned, clogging the streets with tourist who are oblivious to anyone traveling upon them with a purpose.

But at least I got to ride past some goats.
