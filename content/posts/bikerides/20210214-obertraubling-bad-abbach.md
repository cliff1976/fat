It's Valentine's Day, so why not?  And I bike to/from it frequently enough.  The position of the town lends itself to round trips, whether I'm feeling *berg*y or *fluss*y.

Today's route was supposed to trace the Danube back more of the way home, but even before the halfway point at &mdash; you guessed it! &mdash; Bad Abbach, my feet were hurting from the cold.  So at Großprüfening I cut it short.  Still got in just shy of 40 clicks.

## Snaps

Here I am doing a crane kick on my bike.

New shades!

No slope here, it's action photography.  This was on a very flat part of the route.

Most of the first half was through farmland, but there were some woods around the edges.

I suspect the blurriness here might be due to condenstation on the phone's camera's lens.  It gets drippy wet inside this jacket's inside pocket.

Here is a nice stretch of the Danube outside of Unterirading.

Approaching *zur Walba* -- I will very much appreciate stopping in here for a Schnitzel and a Radler when weather and other conditions allow it.
