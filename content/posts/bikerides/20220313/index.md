It was quite cold this morning when I started out, but it was almost pleasant in the sun while not moving.  Full sun while moving was tolerable at least, but moving in the shade almost wasn't.  Should have worn my gloves, but I thought I'd warm up more than I actually did.

Last week I meant to do this route, but I wussed out at the temperature in the morning and cut it short.  Today I stuck it out!
