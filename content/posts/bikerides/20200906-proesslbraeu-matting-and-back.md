It's been a couple weeks (weather and general life happening), but the weather was supposed to be great today (and it was), so I wanted to take advantage of it.  A couple weekends ago our pal *Special K* came up to visit and brought her bike.  That Saturday it rained like God had decided on a Do-Over, but there was a pottery market happening at Kloster Adlersberg.  I thought that would be a nice bike destination under decent weather conditions, and I was right.


The snaps:

The *Eiserner Brücke* has been temporarily renamed after Michael Buschheuer, the founder of the [Sea-Eye](https://sea-eye.org/) Mediterranean rescue organization HQ'd in Regensburg:

The Danube was very peaceful this morning before 9:00 a.m.

I turned north about 3/4 of the way to Mariaort and headed towards Adlersberg.

Honestly I could have gone for a beer and a plate of cheese and a few sausages right then upon arrival, and they looked ready for me, but not a creature was stirring.

So I admired the view and the ride down into the valley.

I took a break at the Naab and watched a rowing crew obey the sing-songy stroke orders through a megaphone as they propelled themselves upstream.

I continued along the train tracks, crossing the Danube too, and made my way south towards Matting.  I realized I missed my turn-off at Unterirading and tried to short-cut my way through the woods.  That did not work so well and I wore myself out getting up the hill on the off-road paths.  I had to push my bike for a few hundred meters until I got back onto a gravel-paved path and continued toward Niedergebraching, and my old arch-enemy Großberg.  This time I made it all the way up to the top of Großberg without stopping, but it was a slog.  At least everything from Ziegetsdorf back home was an easy coast.

I especially liked the irony of the half-torn off "stickers forbidden" sticker on the post with all the other stickers on it.
