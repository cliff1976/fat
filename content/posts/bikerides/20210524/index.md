It was *Pfingstmontag* and I had the day off of work.  I intended a nice long ride, but

* I just wasn't feeling it, and
* I took a wrong turn near Burgweinting, and again at Obertraubling, and decided to swing by the airstrip, and
* the rain was threatening the whole time

So I cut it drastically short.  But it was still a pretty good ride.  Kinda got the impression that glider was following me though.
