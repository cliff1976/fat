*Kurzarbeit* tomorrow -- presumably the last one for this round of economic crises (or, let's hope so anyways).  I had an important week at work last week, so to be there for all of it, I opted to make my last *Kurzabeit* day of the month the last Monday of the month instead of Friday. 

I planned out my route using GraphHopper.com -- first time using that service, but I am sure I'll be back.  It lets you pick multiple destinations, rearrange their order (similar to that Big Internet Company With a Prominent G's mapping product), but also download that route result as a GPX track.  Which means I could follow that exact route on my bike.

Notes:  

+ the 15% grade down the hill towards Pielenhofen is fun
+ but pause a moment there (if you can) to take in the Kloster's beauty from up there on the hill
+ GET THAT BRAKE MAINTENANCE
