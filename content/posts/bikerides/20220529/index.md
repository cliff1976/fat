Heh; it wasn't *my* marathon.  The Regensburg marathon is today.  I was only going to do about 30 km, not 26 miles.  But along the way the weather started looking foreboding (much earlier than predicted), and glancing down, my rear tire looked a little low.  So I cut my route way short in order to beat the rain home, and... still got rained on.  Not drenched, but enough that a nice warm cup of tea was just my...cup of tea.
