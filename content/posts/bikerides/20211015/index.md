I needed to burn off some energy after a frustrating work week.  Thus the
zigzagging you see in the football stadium's parking lot (southeast corner of
my route).  The snaps aren't great because of how dark it was already.  I
anticipated this, so I shot a video of basically the southwest corner of my
route to the northwest corner.  You'll want to turn the sound off for that.  It's not pleasant.
