I figure if I do the climb at Adlersberg enough, one of these days I'll be up at the top and reward myself with a nice *Radler* (I mean, what else?) and maybe some lunch.  That hill is a beast.  Today I took a water and *Schüttelbrot* break in the bus shelter just outside the Prösslbräu grounds (and...good to know that there is bus service up there; that brewery makes delicious things).  But the route down from there was new from me.  See the indicated time of 10:04 to note just how narrow that ROAD is with the 16% grade and 30 km/h speed limit.  Glad I didn't end up on someone's porch!
