Another beautiful day.  I mostly followed the [*Schlössertour*](https://www.landkreis-regensburg.de/freizeit-tourismus/radeln/nicht-beschilderte-touren/#/de/landkreis-regensburg/default/detail/Tour/t_100081303/schloessertour-radtour) from the *Landkreis Regensburg*.  [^1]

The first leg was on the west bank of the Regen up to Regenstauf.  I'd done that before.  Very nice and level.

The new bits started at Ramspau.  It got lots more challenging from that point on.  I thought it would be done with at Kürn, but nope.  The path was sometimes paved, sometimes supposed to be paved, but under construction, and sometimes forest trail.  Wherever it wasn't paved, there were big potholes to avoid.  My setup has no shock absorbers but the ones built into *me*, so I swerved a lot to avoid them -- especially on the downhill traily parts.
