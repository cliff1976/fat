Rain was predicted for all day today, so I did [a 26-km ride yesterday](../20210821)...but then it kinda looked OK early this afternoon, at least for a couple hours, and since it was less than 30 km, the ol' carcass wasn't complaining too much, so why not?  

I saddled up and headed out east, away from the likely soure of the rain.

In the end, I made it back before the rain arrived, but not by much.
