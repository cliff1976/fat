Thursday, June 3rd was *Fronleichnam* ("Happy Cadaver").  Most people I work with took Friday as a *Brückentag* (bridge day)...but not me.  I worked a good chunk of a normal day, finishing what I wanted to achieve before next week, and headed out for an evening ride, on purpose shooting for about 20 km.  I took a brand new (to me) route to the northeast heading through the Konradsiedlung, Wutzlhofen, on a tangent to Haslbach on my way to Irlbach.  I looped around some neighborhoods on my way down a long, slow hill past Grünthal back down into Regensburg.  The weather was ideal; quite the opposite of what I rode through a couple days later.
