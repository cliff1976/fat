It started out another beautiful day.  Didn't stick.  Thought I'd conquer that hill through the woods outside Leoprechting.  Nope!  Had to push my bike for a lot of it.  At least partly that's because the dirt track had turned into mud and a tractor chewed it up real good 5 minutes before me.

I rode past the ~~Continental~~ Arena and then through a field (didn't like that so much; felt like trespassing), towards Leoprechting, onto Niedergebraching [^1], and the clouds were ominous.  I thought I would be lucky and my route would take me around the edge of the rainy patch of sky.  When I finally reached the outskirts of Bad Abbach, I got rained on pretty good there, so I ducked into a parking shelter and waited out the worst of it. 

I hauled ass on the way back because I was cold and wet.  By the time I got home, I was dry, but still cold.  I fell asleep in the tub.
