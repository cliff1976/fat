First time back in the saddle after about a month, and it is no longer Panama Jack helmet weather.  Also, when I got started this morning, it was foggy as heck, so I through on an eye-catching vest just for good measure.  After about 30 minutes, it wasn't really necessary anymore -- the sun burned off the low-hanging clouds.

I stuck to a very familiar route, since I haven't been on the bike in about a month.  I'd planned to extend it into Stadtamhof or the Oberer Wöhrd, but when I got to Großprüfening my quads were aching, and so I cut it short.  Almost the exact same distance as my previous ride, so that's good, I guess.

The snaps!
