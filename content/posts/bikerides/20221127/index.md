It was cold and wet &mdash; not rainy, just moist.  That's the weather I like, typically.  But my feet got achingly cold.  From here on out towards spring, I guess I'll need insulated boots and warmer socks.



## Snaps
The bike-mounted snaps are off by an hour in their timestamps because I still haven't set that camera's clock for *Winterzeit*.

## Video
You'll want to turn the sound off for this (I forgot to remove it).  It's annoying.  It's a section of bike path (and maybe one-way road for cards) headed south down a hill parallel to the B16.

## Route
The route was a very similar one to many previous rides &mdash; only this time I messed up by following a sign towards Bad Abbach at Gra√ülfing (oddly, my destination was Bad Abbach and I needed to go *against* the sign) and had to backtrack a bit.  Also, when I paused at Matthing for a water break, I forgot to resume route recording.  D'oh!

## Stats
