I needed to hit the packaging-free store again, and it was kind of a holiday weekend (*Christi Himmelfahrt*, or Ascension for those keeping score at home), and there was a window of agreeable weather.  (The rest of this weekend has been pretty iffy, weather-wise.)  So, after work on Friday, I got on the ol' *Drahtesel* once again and headed up to Regenstauf to [Quantum Satis](https://www.quantum-satis.de/) to refill my own containers of 

+ basmatic rice
+ pinto (a.k.a. *borlotti* a.k.a. *Wacholder*) beans
+ green caradmom pods
+ star anise
+ chick peas (a.k.a. garbanzo beans and *Kichererbsen*)

It's a nice smooth 15 km ride one-way.  On the way back, I saw a game of cricket in progress!  I have never seen that before in Germany.  I managed to snap a photo of it.
