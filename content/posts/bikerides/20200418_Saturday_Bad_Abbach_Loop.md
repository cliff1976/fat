Another beautiful day &mdash; well, at the beginning.  By the end of my ride, the clouds started looming and threatening rain, but I got home before that started.  And it blew over anyways.  

I had worried about two things:

1. Headed south out of Regensburg is a more direct route, but getting up those hills and down in to Bad Abbach would be a real pain.  

2. The ferry at Matting would be closed due to Corona stuff.

*I was right about both of them.*  But no matter.  It was still a pleasant ride &mdash; at least back from Bad Abbach.
