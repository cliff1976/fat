It's cold enough now for a full-on winter jacket out there, thus the attire switch.

I thought I would give the ol' quadriceps a break and stick to some very level terrain.  You can't go wrong with following the Danube for a nice, level ride.  I still managed to take a wrong turn or two, but I never had to backtrack.  In a couple places along my route, it's not obvious whether a biker should go left or right to stay on a path.  At one point, I ended up on a frozed-grass-and-mud tractor trail, but the end was in sight, so I just pressed on.

I got buzzed by a helicopter over a farm.

I stopped here (and have done so before) for a clementine and water break.

The river was very calm today.

What the heck is this, an ambient temperature sauna?

OK, so *FINALLY* the Romantischer Weihnachtsmarkt is not following the same procedure as every year.  But *verschoben* to when?  Will this be a *Weihnachtsfr√ºhling*?
