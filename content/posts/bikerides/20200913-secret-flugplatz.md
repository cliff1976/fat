Well, secret to me, anyways.  I didn't know it was there.  I woke up just before 6, got my coffee on, and was out on the road at 7:45.  I've started a couple bikerides this year intending to make it all the way to Kallmünz.  Today was another of those that fell short.  Not that the ride wasn't fulfilling.  I didn't know there was a *Flugplatz* in Oberhub, so I detoured even more up a hill to check it out.  It was apparently active, because a half an hour while taking a water break on top of another hill several kilometers away I saw a plane take off from it.

That *Flugplatz* distracted me from my original route and I continued on to Schnepfenberg instead of bearing northwest towards Oberhub and, ultimately Kallmünz.  I turned south at Buchenlohe, cruised through Hohenwarth, and then tried a shortcut through a forest west of Steinsberg.  Not a good idea.  I backtracked and finally came back down onto paved roads for the rest of the trip.  Note well:  I hit 54 km/h on the hill headed south out of the *Schwaighauser Forst* on R15 towards Kaulhausen!

The snaps!

It was cool this morning and I was happy to get into the sun.

Most of the climb on the first half of the trip was fairly gentle.

*Flugplatz?*  Baroo?

Then a whole lotta farmland after missing my turn towards Kallmünz.

Tried to short-cut it through some woods.  Bad idea.  Had to backtrack.  Did not escape fully unscathed.

But that did not dampen my spirits.

And when I got back into town, I saw that tour groups are running again, to my surprise.  Lots of chin-masking there.  They looked like river cruisers, but there were no ships in port that I saw, so I wonder if that was a bus group.
