Another beautiful day.

I thought by doing another few dozen kilometers today after just doing it on Sunday I would feel less sore, and build up some butt callouses.

Nope!  But it was a nice ride anyways.  The part of the Regensburg-Falkenstein bike route on an old train track was great and deserves more attention.  The bit through the *Kreuther Forst* was a bit much going up, but coming down above the *Donaustauf Klinik* was nice.
