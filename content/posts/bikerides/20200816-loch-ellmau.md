After last week's 60+km record breaker, I toned it back down again to 50ish today.  I thought I would treat myself to some nice flat stretches along a river for the last leg.  I am not so sure that is the right approach; "mostly flat" is "partly hilly" and even where truly flat, I was tired of being in the saddle, and mad at friction for forcing me to keep pedaling.

I went north and west in a counter-clockwise loop to some places with goofy-sounding names:

+ Oberschlag (reminds of *Schlagobers* in Austrian hot chocolate contexts)
+ Ellmau (made me *L*augh *M*y *A*ss *O*ff)
+ Loch ("hole"!?)

Notes:  

+ GPS didn't start tracking my progress until I was already across the Donau for some damn reason
+ 5 storks in one field (at least one was a youngster and harder to see)!
+ More river sportos out there today (we are still deep in the *Sommerferien* after all):  paddleboards, personal watercraft, fishing huts
+ Along the Naab, south of Pielenhofen, maybe around Distelhausen there were a bunch of very non-typical German-looking houses.  The kind I rather would have expected in the fancier neighborhoods of KCMO.  Weird.
+ I rather enjoyed the 4 km downhill stretch from Trischlberg towards Heitzenhofen.
+ Around Duggendorf I took a little break and accidentally stopped counting my calories and exertion times.
