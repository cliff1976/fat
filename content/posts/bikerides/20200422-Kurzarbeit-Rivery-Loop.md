Another beautiful day, and one mandated off work.  Thanks, Corona.  

My brain still woke me up at workday time, so why not make a bike ride of it?  It was kind of cold for just shorts and a teesh, but I figured that's motivation for me to keep moving.  Right in the first 10 minutes I spotted two old pals, one of whom has a new doggy, "Spock".  That was along the Danube.  I followed pieces of two more rivers (the Naab and the Schwarze Laaber) on this trip.

Also happened upon three separate groups of geese.
