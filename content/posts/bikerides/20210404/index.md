Happy Easter!

It's been an ecumenical year since [I started doing this](../20200412_easter-sunday/).  Time flies even when you've got nowhere (on the larger scale) to go.

I went back to the region where [I slid down a mountain on my butt](../20210206-sinzing-ring/), but this time I was *very* careful about the elevation over horizontal distance.  I learned from that mistake, for sure.

It was not even 45 kilometers, but more of those were uphill than I am ready for, so I am moving slowly around the house for the rest of today.  I'd say the skies and views made it worth it, though.

Some observations on this route:

+ Saxberg...I thought that street called "Regensburger Steig" was going to be my undoing, but I got through it OK, and looking at my average pulse for the whole trip, I did better than I thought.
+ Watch for Shetland ponies between Reichenstetten and Dürrnstetten.
+ Lindach is very smelly.  *Frische Landluft.*  Some people like that.

Saw a few Shetland ponies near Reichenstetten and Dürrnstetten.

This is where I was *supposed* to come down from the hill when I slid down on my butt.

## Video Recap
These are a couple descents:  

+ a steep one down into and through Eilsbrunn (past the World's Oldest Gaststätte)
+ a gentle one headed into Reichenstetten

I removed the audio track because it's just buzzy vibrations of the camera inside its protective case.

## Route
You might need to tap or click the map to make it bigger.  The red solid route was my intention.  The blue dashed route is my actual route.  I deviated from the planned route on purpose on the way back to go through the Roter-Brach-Weg neighborhoods.
