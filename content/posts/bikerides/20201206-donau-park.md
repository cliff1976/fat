After last week's flat Danube odyssey, I thought I could probably handle at least the uphill bits on the way to Pentling and bask in the river bank's flat glory on my way back &mdash; especially since I didn't feel like a three-hour tour (a three-hour tour) today, and chopped my route down to a mere 20 km.  

I was right in theory; but in practice, GraphHopper picked a route for me right up a tractor track between a couple of fields, which was steeper than I expected.  Probably would have been NBD in June, but in December, with my city tires, eventually I spun my rear wheel and had to get off and push a bit.  Fortunately the downhills were all clear and dry, and the rest of the snowy bits were not icy.  Lesson learned:  probably "bike" is a just-fine setting for GraphHopper in the spring, summer, and fall, but for the possibility of icy hills in the winter, I need to tell it I want "racing bike" routes to keep me outta them frozen tractor tracks.

You can see that everyone else wanted to use the Danube banks for a walk/jog/ride today, too.  It got kinda hard to enforce a 2-meter distance what with oncoming traffic and all.

## Snap

Just one to speak of.  I saw a mess of ducks just floating there in a calm stretch of Danube.  It was a good time for a little water break, so I stopped at the nearest bench and approached them to take this shot.  However, presence (on the shore!) seemed to alarm them and they bugged out for the opposite shore.  I wonder if they have negative associations with people in day-glo flourescent outerwear...
