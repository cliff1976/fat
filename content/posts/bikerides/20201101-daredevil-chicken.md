This dude is definitely undeserving of his reputation!

I took a suggestion from [local pal Markus](http://markusfeilner.de) and went out southwest towards Mangolding, Mintraching and Geisling.  Those were new towns for me, but the route back along the B8 through Barbing was old hat.  Pretty flat the whole way, so it should have been a good opportunity to keep my heart rate low and steady.  Alas, I pushed it more than I should have for the optimal effort/effect ratio.

Only one snap to speak of from this ride -- they all kinda looked like this.  Gray skies, rainy glasses, some orangey colors, but also still some greens.
