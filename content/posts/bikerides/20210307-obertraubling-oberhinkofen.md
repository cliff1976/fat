I intended this week's ride to be a little on the short side, but I missed a turn in Obertraubling, tried to invent a new route to Oberhinkofen, had to backtrack, and got there the long way.  It was cold, but not unbearably so, and a hot jamaica break in Obertraubling was a good way to warm up internally.
