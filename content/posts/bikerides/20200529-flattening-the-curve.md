*Kurzarbeit* again today.  I decided not to torture myself with a mountainous bike ride, but instead stick to a flat loop out south and east of town.  This was along the [R7](https://www.landkreis-regensburg.de/freizeit-tourismus/radeln/beschilderte-touren/#/de/landkreis-regensburg/default/detail/Tour/t_2599/radtour-r7-ins-drei-seen-land) route recommended by the *Landkreis Regensburg*.

Sarching's amphibious cacophony:

I messed up my own GPX track recording on this one, forgetting to separate this track from an aborted one on Wednesday, which explains the teleportation from home to the *Ostbahnhof* area.
