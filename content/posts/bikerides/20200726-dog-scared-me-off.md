I've been doing my rides mostly on the weekends, since *Kurzarbeit* is over for me now.  I've been lazy about posting them, but less lazy about actually doing them.  So that's good.

In my last post, I picked GraphHopper.com as a mapping service, but I'm wary of it now.  This time it routed me through a farm at the top of a long, slow hill at Aignhof... and a Rottweiler-looking dog was quite angry at my presence.  I high-tailed it back down the hill, with the dog loudly baring teeth at calf-height and decided to try to get around the hill, and the farm, through a different *Dorf* past a *Ponyhof* to get back to my original route.  Well, guess what?  That also led to Mr. Choppers.  But this time there was a sign.

At that point, I cut my route short, from the original 50 km down to a little over 30.  There were a lot more hills in the mix this time, so I didn't mind heading home early at all.

Notes:  

+ Tremmelhauserh√∂he looks like a lovely place for a walk
+ Think real hard about bike routes suggested by GraphHopper.com and maybe have an alternative plan in mind
+ Biding my time with predictions from the *RegenRadar* worked out great -- missed the morning and afternoon showers
