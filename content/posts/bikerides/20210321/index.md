Despite the weather prediction I got out there again today.  I had planned to do a ring around Regensburg so that I wouldn't be obligated to wear a mask, which I rather dislike while on my bike (it's not so bad except for the fact that I wear glasses).  Almost right off the bat, I veered off from my planned course, but this only resulted in a a total route of a few kilometers less than the original route.  At at least two more points along the way, path closures forced me to deviate.

I was a little underdressed, but it was mostly fine as long as I kept moving.  My *jamaica* tea break along the Danube was well-placed.

The snow was the wet, blowy, sting-y kind that hurts upon impact with your face.

I didn't realize I was on a closed path until I got to the end of these hundreds of meters of pipes.

## Video Recap

None today; just a still of me exceeding the speed limit.
