I did a Saturday ride instead of Sunday.  The weather has been so iffy lately that it didn't make sense to wait and see how Sunday would shape up.

It was a little easier to stay on the road outside Kühschlag, and avoid the inner workings of the bustling metropolis that is Downtown Nittendorf, so I opted to deviate from the planned route a bit there.

And for the stretch from Kneiting to roughly the Pfaffenstein tunnel was *STILL* under construction, so I followed the detour instructions through Winzer, which was pleasant.

Towards the end of my ride the sun started to come out, but for the first three fourths of the ride, I didn't need sunglasses.  It's a little less picturesque that way, but sure makes the exercise more tolerable.

I forgot to wear my heart rate monitor on this ride, so the calorie stats are missing.  But I can offer geographic ones instead.
