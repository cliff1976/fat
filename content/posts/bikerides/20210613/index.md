I went up <a href="../20200524-finally-beat-that-hill/">those</a> <a href="../20200501-runnin-up-that-hill/">hills</a> south of Regensburg on the way to Pentling that used to discourage me.  I won't say they're easy now, but I can chug along in my lowest gear without feeling like I'm risking a heart attack.  Basically abandon all hope, ye who enter Kumpfm√ºhl...it's a long, mostly uphill slog to Hohengebraching.  But after that it was pretty nice all the rest of the way back home.
