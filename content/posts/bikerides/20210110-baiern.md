First ride of the year!  I'd taken a couple weekends off, which stretched out
to over a month, because I was worried about the moisture on the ground and the
wintry temperatures resulting in icy conditions.  I tried to walk more in
the meantime.  That kinda worked, but not as much as I'd hoped.  

I thought it was a little weird to leave Regensburg and cross into Baiern.  I mean the standard local historical thing is that Regensburg was a free imperial city for a long time and by crossing the Danube into Stadtamhof, one was leaving Regensburg and entering Bavaria (*Bayern*).  But I crossed the municipal limits into a town called *Baiern*.  It seems there are a whole mess of these:  <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayern_(Begriffskl%C3%A4rung)">https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayern_(Begriffskl%C3%A4rung)</a>

Today was the first time back in the saddle, so I chose a route that I thought
the ol' cheeks could handle &mdash; just 25ish km.  I goofed up a little around
Lappersdorf and had to backtrack a bit.  And I opted to head back home via the
Nibelungenbrücke instead of cutting through the Altstadt, which would have
obligated me to wear a mask.  And they are getting *serious* about enforcement
(rightly so!).  So, bonus.

Just one of me today.  You can watch the video if you like.  The snow around 10:30 a.m. was kinda pretty, but the rest of it is quite gray and drab.
