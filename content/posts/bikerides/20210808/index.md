It had been kinda rainy lately, and in fact it started up again just now, but there was a window of beautiful weather this morning, so I jumped on it.  

And so did thousands of slugs.  I did my best not to run them over, but I can't promise all my swerves were successful.

This was a good route for getting back into a routine after a couple weeks off:  

+ a few mostly flat KMs on the way to Adlersberg
+ a grueling hill up to the Prösslbräu (should have rewarded myself with a *Radler*, but it was only 10:30.  Still, they might have been open already)
+ a less-grueling hill up into Pettendorf
+ a couple more little hills outside of Kaulhausen and Baiern and Hainsacker on the way back down into Regensburg through Kareth
