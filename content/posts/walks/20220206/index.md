Due to travel and holidays I kinda took 3 months off of my irregularly scheduled programming.  Even though there was some unscheduled exercise walking around in [new](https://www.regensblog.com/2022/01/30/vivan-las-vacaciones-parte-dos/) and [familiar places](https://www.regensblog.com/2022/01/30/vivan-las-vacaciones-parte-uno/), there probably wasn't enough in general, and that's not good.

So, here's the first attempt at getting back up on that horse, off of which I kinda threw myself.
