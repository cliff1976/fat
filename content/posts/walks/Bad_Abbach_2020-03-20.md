This was the last chance to leave town before the *Ausgangsbeschr√§nkung* went into effect at midnight tonight, so we took it.  We also saw 

+ where our pal gets all those beautiful mystical forest shots of his dogs, and 
+ some [ancient Celtic mystery forest stuff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viereckschanze) [*cue the spooky music*], and 
+ the foundations of an old Roman bathhouse as the ruins from a [Villa Rustica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_rustica)
