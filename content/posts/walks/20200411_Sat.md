Scored fresh, local, green asparagus at the *Donaumarkt* -- grilled it for dinner for the second day in a row.  Was a great accompaniment to the *Bärlauchrisotto* Sarah made.

*Desweiteren* we went to [*Tutto Italiano*](https://www.tutto-italiano.de/) for the first time and found some stuff that [Il Mercato](https://www.tutto-italiano.de/) does not carry.  Including wine from [*Badia a Coltibuono*](https://www.regensblog.com/2019/05/30/good-harvest-at-badia-a-coltibuono/)!  What a score!

Two routes, 11.3 km total today:

The splotchy bits are our wanderings inside the [Lukullus Polish market on *Greflingerstraße*](https://www.lukullus-laden.eu/) and *Tutto Italiano* and REWE.
