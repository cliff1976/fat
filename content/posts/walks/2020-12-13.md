I was going to do another shorty 20 or maybe 30km bike ride today, but the weather prediction changed and I decided that if there was a chance of rain and temperatures hovering around freezing, I'd rather be on foot.  So I did a long walk instead.

## Snaps

Got a new sweatshirt for my recent birthday from my parents.  That thing is *warm.*  Was great today for this long, dreary walk.

Just a reminder:

It got really muddy following a woodsy river bank path.

I thought I was taking a short cut, but was blocked by a lagoon inlet.
