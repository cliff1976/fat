Bright sunny day and cold, but not bitterly so.  The sun and the activity warmed us up such that a brief stop in the shade (or the wind over the dam) was plenty to cool us down again.

Lots of other people had the same idea -- taking advantage of the weather today.  Let's hope that doesn't result in another Corona spike -- the extended lockdown has been working pretty well this time.  We're down to about 30 new infections reported in the last seven days, adjusted for 100,000 inhabitants.  In fact, there were so many other people enjoying the south bank of the Danube that we cut into some parks on the way back; there were lots fewer people on those paths than directly along the river.

The red solid line was the route I'd planned; the blue dashed line is the route we actually took.
