We drove about 15 minutes north to the town of Regenstauf to shop at [Quantum Satis](https://www.quantum-satis.de/) &mdash; same as last weekend.  This time, we did a longer walk afterwards and brought a pal (newish to Regensburg) along for the shop and chat.  It was a nice day for it.  The original route would have led us into a hilly, muddy (owing to the rain the previous night), woody area, so we stuck to the road and even went a little farther than expected.
