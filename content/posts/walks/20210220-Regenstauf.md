We took the car up to Regenstauf on a very small shopping trip.  We headed specifically to [Quantum Satis](https://www.quantum-satis.de/), packaging-free store.  They have a LOT of the stuff we use on a daily basis available in bulk.  So even though it costs a lot more (compared to the typical grocery store fare), I'd like to start refilling pantry staples from that store, without incurring packaging waste.  

Side note:  there is another great packaging-free store in downtown Regensburg -- [FÃ¼llgut](https://www.fuellgutregensburg.de/) (which has a nice pun in its name).  Same concept, but it's a MUCH smaller store and it always feels kind of cramped to me.  This was not as big a deal pre-Corona.  I visited the store once before, last year, on a bike trip.  I could totally do a bike trip once a week to Quantum Satis to restock on dry goods, transporting a few at a time home in my saddle bag.

After the shopping, we took a walk along some protected wetlands.  Plenty of storks and swans were hanging around, getting their bird stuff on.  When we got back to the car, parked near a bridge over the river, we saw a swan guarding one entire loaf of bread and devouring another.  Watch your carbs, bud.

## Route
I forgot to set my GPS properly.  It was approximately this:

Distance:         about 5 km
