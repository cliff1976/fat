It was another *Kurzarbeit* day.  I had to skip my walks a couple days this week, so I stretched this out one longer on purpose.  I made it up to the *Fernsehturm* in Ziegetsdorf, walked parallel to the A3 towards the *Uniklinikum* and back.  It was threatening to rain most of the way with some nice patches of sun to break things up.
