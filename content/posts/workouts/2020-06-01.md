Holiday weekend!  (*Fronleichnam*, I think).    I took my first walk through the *Evangelischer Zentralfriedhof*, which had a nice mix of sun and shade.  I was kind of expecting more activity in there due to the holiday, but there was no one stirring.


Snaps:

The pit between Alberstra√üe and Ernst-Reuter-Platz is now fully empty; still don't know what's going in there.

Absolutely **nothing** happening at Hauptbahnhof, which felt weird, even for a public holiday.
