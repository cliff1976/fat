Another beautiful day.  

Did a loop behind the Max-Stra√üe McD's up and down some steps for fun.  It was not very fun.

Snaps:

Route:

It would appear that my app did not save my route.  It was from our house through the southern end of the Altstadt with some loops in the western part, and back home via the south bank of the Danube.
