Felt like it was harder to stay in the target heart range -- maybe because of the four-day gap since the previous workout.  I may need to start going more than 3 days a week, which also means maybe going on at least one weekend day, eating into shopping time on Saturdays, or being crowded on Sundays.  Yuck.
