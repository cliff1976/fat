GPS went nutty again today.  I don't know if 

* it's something atmospheric, or 
* the satellites were out of alignment, or
* the case on my phone, or 
* whether or not the phone's in a pocket or loose in my hand, or
* an intermittent hardware problem is wreaking havoc

But I for sure did not follow the exact path shown in the route.

I did find the use of rubber gloves hanging from the bridge the near florist's shop under the bridge quite attractive.
