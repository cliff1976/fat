A cloudy, overcast morning.  I was hoping for some nice sunrise edge-of-cloud views, but I think I was too late off the mark to get them.  Instead I discovered a new (to me) tiny park almost directly south of our house.  Also, I forgot to start my route tracker, so I missed the first 500 meters or so of the route.  Dang it.
