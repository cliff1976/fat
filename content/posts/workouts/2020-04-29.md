A moderately rainy morning after several weeks of almost no rain.  No inspiring photographs today; my walk was through neighborhoods and apartment complexes.

I did notice the *Singh Indischer Markt* seems to have been replaced with a Middle Eastern market of some kind.

And somehow I must have lost GPS connectivity along the way there towards the end, because I definitely did not sneak through anyone's house.  Promise.
