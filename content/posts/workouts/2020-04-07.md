Another beautiful day.  

Had to wait for a train in the *Hafengebiet*.  Crossed a waterway along a train bridge &mdash; next time I think I'll go all the way to Schwabelweis for a longer walk.  Weird junky art stuff near the industrial recycling place right at the path leading from the bridge back down onto the south bank of the Danube.
