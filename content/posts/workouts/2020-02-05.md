First weigh-in of the year.  Surprisingly:  I'm down about 9.5 kg from June 2019 and 8 kg from October 2019 at the doctor's office.  Either:

+ one (or both?) of the scales are miscalibrated, or
+ I have lost weight by going on vacation in December (???), or 
+ something evil is happening and I'm losing weight for bad reasons.
