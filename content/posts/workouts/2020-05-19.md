I walked into work, grabbed some masks from my desk the company had set out for me, and came back via the supermarket.  It was longer and slower, but I bought groceries, ran an errand, and even saw another person in the office, in person -- did not expect that.  I might have surprised her, too.

That mosque near work is coming along nicely.  Looking forward to their lunch counter opening...if I ever return to working in the office.
