A pretty dreary morning (most of them have been lately after those glorious weeks in March and April).  But walked along the *WÃ¶hrd* and took the stairs right down the water line in a few places.  It's been somewhat rainy, but the river wasn't running particularly high or fast.  I got a special treat:  watching a barge with a lift switch out a riverway sign.
