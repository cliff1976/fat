Messed around and got there later than I intended &mdash; 9:30 instead of the crack of 9.  It was already kinda smelly in there.  I guess that's my penance.  Mix of old and young people, but very few in between in my demographic.  The Crossfit OONCE OONCE OONCE started at 10, which is another reason to get in and get out before they crank it up.
