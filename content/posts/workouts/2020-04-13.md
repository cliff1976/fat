Another beautiful day.  A *Schnitzeljagd* of sorts, even.  

*Weltenburger am Dom* is closed, apparently not even doing take-out, but the *Kreuzsch√§nke* is accepting carry-out orders.  I like that they encourage their patrons to bring their own food storage containers to reduce waste.

Also, the *Spanier im Bruckmandl* is no more.  Some kind of *Currywurst* joint is there now?
